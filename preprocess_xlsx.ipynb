In Drosophila, three cecropin genes have previously been characterized, CecA1, CecA2, and CecB, in a dense cluster at 99E on the third chromosome. From the same locus, we now describe a fourth member of the cecropin gene family, CecC, which is mainly expressed at the early pupal stage. In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box. It consists of three shorter motifs, two of which are reminiscent of a putative promoter element in immune protein genes from the cecropia moth.",

This response is manifested by an increased number of circulating cells, the hemocytes, and by the appearance of a specialized class of hemocyte, the lamellocytes, which participate in the encapsulation and killing of the parasite. To study the molecular mechanisms of this response, we have overexpressed different genes in the hemocytes, by using the GAL4-upstream activating sequence system and a hemocyte-specific Hemese-GAL4 driver. Multiple transgenes were tested, representing several important signaling pathways. We found that the proliferation response and the activation of lamellocyte formation are independent phenomena. A drastic increase in the number of circulating hemocytes is caused by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as Egfr, Pvr, and Alk, as well as by the downstream signaling components Ras85D and pointed, supporting the notion that the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway regulates hemocyte numbers. In the case of Pvr and Alk, this phenotype also is accompanied by lamellocyte formation. By contrast, constitutively active hopscotch and hemipterous give massive activation of lamellocyte formation with little or no increase in total hemocyte numbers. This finding indicates that both the Jak/Stat and the Jun kinase pathways affect lamellocyte formation. Still other signals, mediated by aop(ACT), Toll(10b), and Rac1 expression, cause a simultaneous increase in lamellocyte and total cell numbers, and the same effect is seen when WNT signaling is suppressed. We conclude that the activation of a cellular response is complex and affected by multiple signaling pathways.",

The defence against Gram-positive bacteria and natural fungal infections is mediated by the Toll signalling pathway, whereas defence against Gram-negative bacteria is dependent on the Immune deficiency (IMD) pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. The link between microbial infections and activation of these two pathways has remained elusive. The Toll pathway is activated by Gram-positive bacteria through a circulating Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). PGRPs appear to be highly conserved from insects to mammals, and the Drosophila genome contains 13 members. Here we report a mutation in a gene coding for a putative transmembrane protein, PGRP-LC, which reduces survival to Gram-negative sepsis but has no effect on the response to Gram-positive bacteria or natural fungal infections. By genetic epistasis, we demonstrate that PGRP-LC acts upstream of the imd gene. The data on PGRP-SA with respect to the response to Gram-positive infections, together with the present report, indicate that the PGRP family has a principal role in sensing microbial infections in Drosophila.",

From the same locus, we now describe a fourth member of the cecropin gene family, CecC, which is mainly expressed at the early pupal stage. In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box. It consists of three shorter motifs, two of which are reminiscent of a putative promoter element in immune protein genes from the cecropia moth.",

A peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRP, has been cloned from moths as well as vertebrates and has been shown to participate in peptidoglycan-mediated activation of prophenoloxidase in the silk moth. Here we report that Drosophila expresses 12 PGRP genes, distributed in 8 chromosomal loci on the 3 major chromosomes. By analyzing cDNA clones and genomic databases, we grouped them into two classes: PGRP-SA, SB1, SB2, SC1A, SC1B, SC2, and SD, with short transcripts and short 5'-untranslated regions; and PGRP-LA, LB, LC, LD, and LE, with long transcripts and long 5'-untranslated regions. The predicted structures indicate that the first group encodes extracellular proteins and the second group, intracellular and membrane-spanning proteins. Most PGRP genes are expressed in all postembryonic stages. Peptidoglycan injections strongly induce five of the genes. Transcripts from the different PGRP genes were found in immune competent organs such as fat body, gut, and hemocytes. We demonstrate that at least PGRP-SA and SC1B can bind peptidoglycan, and a function in immunity is likely for this family.",

In Drosophila, three cecropin genes have previously been characterized, CecA1, CecA2, and CecB, in a dense cluster at 99E on the third chromosome. From the same locus, we now describe a fourth member of the cecropin gene family, CecC, which is mainly expressed at the early pupal stage. In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box. It consists of three shorter motifs, two of which are reminiscent of a putative promoter element in immune protein genes from the cecropia moth.",

Here we show that some Gram-positive bacterial species activate an immune response in a PGRP-SA- and GNBP1-independent manner, indicating that alternative receptors exist. Consistent with this, we noted that PGRP-SD mutants were susceptible to some Gram-positive bacteria and that a loss-of-function mutation in PGRP-SD severely exacerbated the PGRP-SA and GNBP1 mutant phenotypes.

We observed decreased egg laying after bacterial infection that correlated with increased bacterial virulence.

A peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRP, has been cloned from moths as well as vertebrates and has been shown to participate in peptidoglycan-mediated activation of prophenoloxidase in the silk moth. Here we report that Drosophila expresses 12 PGRP genes, distributed in 8 chromosomal loci on the 3 major chromosomes. By analyzing cDNA clones and genomic databases, we grouped them into two classes: PGRP-SA, SB1, SB2, SC1A, SC1B, SC2, and SD, with short transcripts and short 5'-untranslated regions; and PGRP-LA, LB, LC, LD, and LE, with long transcripts and long 5'-untranslated regions. The predicted structures indicate that the first group encodes extracellular proteins and the second group, intracellular and membrane-spanning proteins. Most PGRP genes are expressed in all postembryonic stages. Peptidoglycan injections strongly induce five of the genes. Transcripts from the different PGRP genes were found in immune competent organs such as fat body, gut, and hemocytes. We demonstrate that at least PGRP-SA and SC1B can bind peptidoglycan, and a function in immunity is likely for this family.",

Gram-positive bacteria and fungi predominantly induce the Toll signalling pathway, whereas Gram-negative bacteria activate the Imd pathway. Loss-of-function mutants in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. Genetic screens have identified a range of genes involved in these intracellular signalling cascades, but how they are activated by microbial infection is largely unknown. Activation of the transmembrane receptor Toll requires a proteolytically cleaved form of an extracellular cytokine-like polypeptide, Spätzle, suggesting that Toll does not itself function as a bona fide recognition receptor of microbial patterns. This is in apparent contrast with the mammalian Toll-like receptors and raises the question of which host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns to activate Toll through Spätzle. Here we present a mutation that blocks Toll activation by Gram-positive bacteria and significantly decreases resistance to this type of infection. The mutation semmelweis (seml) inactivates the gene encoding a peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). Interestingly, seml does not affect Toll activation by fungal infection, indicating the existence of a distinct recognition system for fungi to activate the Toll pathway.",

This response is manifested by the appearance of a specialized subset of blood cells, the lamellocytes, which are the key players in the encapsulation and killing of the parasite. The formation of lamellocytes involves the activation of the Toll, the Jun kinase and the JAK/STAT pathways however the minimal requirement for initiation of lamellocyte development in the course of the cellular immune response has not been defined yet. In this study, we tested whether or not the mechanical injury itself, caused by oviposition, could provide a sufficient signal for lamellocyte development. We found that sterile wounding, comparable to that occurring during oviposition, induces normal lamellocyte development. We propose therefore that mechanical damage of the cuticle and subsequent disruption of the basal lamina is a minimal and sufficient single signal for normal lamellocyte development in the course of the cellular immune response of Drosophila.",

As is the case for vertebrate epithelia, insect epithelia appear to be more than passive physical barriers and are likely to constitute an active component of innate immunity.

We show that this gene is also expressed in the fat body of larvae and adults of Drosophila as well as in a tumorous blood cell line: its expression is noticeably enhanced upon bacterial (or lipopolysaccharide) challenge. This challenge also induces within 15-30 min a nuclear translocation of the dorsal protein. The genes encoding inducible antibacterial peptides in Drosophila contain kappa B-related nucleotide sequences and we show that the dorsal protein can bind to such motifs and sequence-specifically transactivate a reporter gene in co-transfection experiments with a Drosophila cell line. However, in dl1 mutants, in the absence of dorsal protein, the genes encoding antibacterial peptides retain their inducibility, suggesting a multifactorial control. The results indicate that in addition to its role in embryogenesis, dorsal is involved in the immune response of Drosophila. They also strengthen the analogy between the mammalian acute phase response and the insect immune response.",

         "Drosophila has highly efficient defenses against infection. These include both cellular immune responses, such as the phagocytosis of invading microorganisms, and humoral immune responses, such as the secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the hemolymph [1] [2]. These defense systems are thought to interact, but the nature and extent of these interactions is not known. Here we describe a method for inhibiting phagocytosis in Drosophila blood cells (hemocytes) by injecting polystyrene beads into the body cavity. This treatment does not in itself make a fly susceptible to Escherichia coli infection. However, when performed on flies carrying the mutation immune deficiency (imd), which affects the humoral immune response [3], the treatment results in a striking decrease in resistance to infection. We therefore carried out a sensitized genetic screen to identify immunocompromised mutants by co-injecting beads and E. coli. From this screen, we identified a new gene we have named red shirt and identified the caspase Dredd as a regulator of the Drosophila immune response. The observation that mutants with defects in the humoral immune response are further immunocompromised by blocking phagocytosis, and thus inhibiting the cellular immune response, shows that the Drosophila cellular and humoral immune responses act in concert to fight infection.",

         "Cecropins are antibacterial peptides, induced in insects in response to bacterial infections. In Drosophila, three cecropin genes have previously been characterized, CecA1, CecA2, and CecB, in a dense cluster at 99E on the third chromosome. From the same locus, we now describe a fourth member of the cecropin gene family, CecC, which is mainly expressed at the early pupal stage. In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box. It consists of three shorter motifs, two of which are reminiscent of a putative promoter element in immune protein genes from the cecropia moth.",

This response is manifested by an increased number of circulating cells, the hemocytes, and by the appearance of a specialized class of hemocyte, the lamellocytes, which participate in the encapsulation and killing of the parasite. To study the molecular mechanisms of this response, we have overexpressed different genes in the hemocytes, by using the GAL4-upstream activating sequence system and a hemocyte-specific Hemese-GAL4 driver. Multiple transgenes were tested, representing several important signaling pathways. We found that the proliferation response and the activation of lamellocyte formation are independent phenomena. A drastic increase in the number of circulating hemocytes is caused by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as Egfr, Pvr, and Alk, as well as by the downstream signaling components Ras85D and pointed, supporting the notion that the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway regulates hemocyte numbers. In the case of Pvr and Alk, this phenotype also is accompanied by lamellocyte formation. By contrast, constitutively active hopscotch and hemipterous give massive activation of lamellocyte formation with little or no increase in total hemocyte numbers. This finding indicates that both the Jak/Stat and the Jun kinase pathways affect lamellocyte formation. Still other signals, mediated by aop(ACT), Toll(10b), and Rac1 expression, cause a simultaneous increase in lamellocyte and total cell numbers, and the same effect is seen when WNT signaling is suppressed. We conclude that the activation of a cellular response is complex and affected by multiple signaling pathways.",

         "Microbial infection activates two distinct intracellular signalling cascades in the immune-responsive fat body of Drosophila. Gram-positive bacteria and fungi predominantly induce the Toll signalling pathway, whereas Gram-negative bacteria activate the Imd pathway. Loss-of-function mutants in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. Genetic screens have identified a range of genes involved in these intracellular signalling cascades, but how they are activated by microbial infection is largely unknown. Activation of the transmembrane receptor Toll requires a proteolytically cleaved form of an extracellular cytokine-like polypeptide, Spätzle, suggesting that Toll does not itself function as a bona fide recognition receptor of microbial patterns. This is in apparent contrast with the mammalian Toll-like receptors and raises the question of which host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns to activate Toll through Spätzle. Here we present a mutation that blocks Toll activation by Gram-positive bacteria and significantly decreases resistance to this type of infection. The mutation semmelweis (seml) inactivates the gene encoding a peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). Interestingly, seml does not affect Toll activation by fungal infection, indicating the existence of a distinct recognition system for fungi to activate the Toll pathway.",

From the same locus, we now describe a fourth member of the cecropin gene family, CecC, which is mainly expressed at the early pupal stage. In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box. It consists of three shorter motifs, two of which are reminiscent of a putative promoter element in immune protein genes from the cecropia moth.",

Here we report that Drosophila expresses 12 PGRP genes, distributed in 8 chromosomal loci on the 3 major chromosomes. By analyzing cDNA clones and genomic databases, we grouped them into two classes: PGRP-SA, SB1, SB2, SC1A, SC1B, SC2, and SD, with short transcripts and short 5'-untranslated regions; and PGRP-LA, LB, LC, LD, and LE, with long transcripts and long 5'-untranslated regions. The predicted structures indicate that the first group encodes extracellular proteins and the second group, intracellular and membrane-spanning proteins. Most PGRP genes are expressed in all postembryonic stages. Peptidoglycan injections strongly induce five of the genes. Transcripts from the different PGRP genes were found in immune competent organs such as fat body, gut, and hemocytes. We demonstrate that at least PGRP-SA and SC1B can bind peptidoglycan, and a function in immunity is likely for this family.",

Croquemort (CRQ) is a CD36-related receptor expressed exclusively on these macrophages. Genetic evidence showed that crq was essential for efficient phagocytosis of apoptotic corpses but was not required for the engulfment of bacteria. The expression of CRQ was regulated by the amount of apoptosis. These data define distinct pathways for the phagocytosis of corpses and bacteria in Drosophila.",

         "Microbial infection activates two distinct intracellular signalling cascades in the immune-responsive fat body of Drosophila. Gram-positive bacteria and fungi predominantly induce the Toll signalling pathway, whereas Gram-negative bacteria activate the Imd pathway. Loss-of-function mutants in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. Genetic screens have identified a range of genes involved in these intracellular signalling cascades, but how they are activated by microbial infection is largely unknown. Activation of the transmembrane receptor Toll requires a proteolytically cleaved form of an extracellular cytokine-like polypeptide, Spätzle, suggesting that Toll does not itself function as a bona fide recognition receptor of microbial patterns. This is in apparent contrast with the mammalian Toll-like receptors and raises the question of which host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns to activate Toll through Spätzle. Here we present a mutation that blocks Toll activation by Gram-positive bacteria and significantly decreases resistance to this type of infection. The mutation semmelweis (seml) inactivates the gene encoding a peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). Interestingly, seml does not affect Toll activation by fungal infection, indicating the existence of a distinct recognition system for fungi to activate the Toll pathway.",

Their structures support the proposal that these glycine-rich antimicrobial peptides evolved from a common ancestor and are probably also related to proline-rich peptides such as drosocin. AttC is similar to the nearby AttA and AttB genes. AttD is more divergent and located on a different chromosome. Intriguingly, AttD may encode an intracellular attacin. DptB is linked in tandem to the closely related Diptericin. However, the DptB gene product contains a furin-like cleavage site and may be processed in an attacin-like fashion. All attacin and diptericin genes are induced after bacterial challenge. This induction is reduced in imd mutants, and unexpectedly also in Tl(-) mutants. The 18w mutation particularly affects the induction of AttC, which may be a useful marker for 18w signaling.",

From the same locus, we now describe a fourth member of the cecropin gene family, CecC, which is mainly expressed at the early pupal stage. In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box. It consists of three shorter motifs, two of which are reminiscent of a putative promoter element in immune protein genes from the cecropia moth.",

A peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRP, has been cloned from moths as well as vertebrates and has been shown to participate in peptidoglycan-mediated activation of prophenoloxidase in the silk moth. Here we report that Drosophila expresses 12 PGRP genes, distributed in 8 chromosomal loci on the 3 major chromosomes. By analyzing cDNA clones and genomic databases, we grouped them into two classes: PGRP-SA, SB1, SB2, SC1A, SC1B, SC2, and SD, with short transcripts and short 5'-untranslated regions; and PGRP-LA, LB, LC, LD, and LE, with long transcripts and long 5'-untranslated regions. The predicted structures indicate that the first group encodes extracellular proteins and the second group, intracellular and membrane-spanning proteins. Most PGRP genes are expressed in all postembryonic stages. Peptidoglycan injections strongly induce five of the genes. Transcripts from the different PGRP genes were found in immune competent organs such as fat body, gut, and hemocytes. We demonstrate that at least PGRP-SA and SC1B can bind peptidoglycan, and a function in immunity is likely for this family.",

         "Microbial infection activates two distinct intracellular signalling cascades in the immune-responsive fat body of Drosophila. Gram-positive bacteria and fungi predominantly induce the Toll signalling pathway, whereas Gram-negative bacteria activate the Imd pathway. Loss-of-function mutants in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. Genetic screens have identified a range of genes involved in these intracellular signalling cascades, but how they are activated by microbial infection is largely unknown. Activation of the transmembrane receptor Toll requires a proteolytically cleaved form of an extracellular cytokine-like polypeptide, Spätzle, suggesting that Toll does not itself function as a bona fide recognition receptor of microbial patterns. This is in apparent contrast with the mammalian Toll-like receptors and raises the question of which host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns to activate Toll through Spätzle. Here we present a mutation that blocks Toll activation by Gram-positive bacteria and significantly decreases resistance to this type of infection. The mutation semmelweis (seml) inactivates the gene encoding a peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). Interestingly, seml does not affect Toll activation by fungal infection, indicating the existence of a distinct recognition system for fungi to activate the Toll pathway.",

This response is manifested by the appearance of a specialized subset of blood cells, the lamellocytes, which are the key players in the encapsulation and killing of the parasite. The formation of lamellocytes involves the activation of the Toll, the Jun kinase and the JAK/STAT pathways however the minimal requirement for initiation of lamellocyte development in the course of the cellular immune response has not been defined yet. In this study, we tested whether or not the mechanical injury itself, caused by oviposition, could provide a sufficient signal for lamellocyte development. We found that sterile wounding, comparable to that occurring during oviposition, induces normal lamellocyte development. We propose therefore that mechanical damage of the cuticle and subsequent disruption of the basal lamina is a minimal and sufficient single signal for normal lamellocyte development in the course of the cellular immune response of Drosophila.",

As a result, the Relish mutants are very sensitive to infection. A single cell of E. cloacae is sufficient to kill a mutant fly, and the mutants show increased susceptibility to fungal infection. In contrast, the blood cell population, the hematopoietic organs, and the phagocytic, encapsulation, and melanization responses are normal. Our results illustrate the importance of the humoral response in Drosophila immunity and demonstrate that Relish plays a key role in this response.",

One of these peptides, drosomycin, is active primarily against fungi. Using a drosomycin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene, we now show that in addition to the fat body, a variety of epithelial tissues that are in direct contact with the external environment, including those of the respiratory, digestive and reproductive tracts, can express the antifungal peptide, suggesting a local response to infections affecting these barrier tissues. As is the case for vertebrate epithelia, insect epithelia appear to be more than passive physical barriers and are likely to constitute an active component of innate immunity.

We show that this gene is also expressed in the fat body of larvae and adults of Drosophila as well as in a tumorous blood cell line: its expression is noticeably enhanced upon bacterial (or lipopolysaccharide) challenge. This challenge also induces within 15-30 min a nuclear translocation of the dorsal protein. The genes encoding inducible antibacterial peptides in Drosophila contain kappa B-related nucleotide sequences and we show that the dorsal protein can bind to such motifs and sequence-specifically transactivate a reporter gene in co-transfection experiments with a Drosophila cell line. However, in dl1 mutants, in the absence of dorsal protein, the genes encoding antibacterial peptides retain their inducibility, suggesting a multifactorial control. The results indicate that in addition to its role in embryogenesis, dorsal is involved in the immune response of Drosophila. They also strengthen the analogy between the mammalian acute phase response and the insect immune response.",

These include both cellular immune responses, such as the phagocytosis of invading microorganisms, and humoral immune responses, such as the secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the hemolymph [1] [2]. These defense systems are thought to interact, but the nature and extent of these interactions is not known. Here we describe a method for inhibiting phagocytosis in Drosophila blood cells (hemocytes) by injecting polystyrene beads into the body cavity. This treatment does not in itself make a fly susceptible to Escherichia coli infection. However, when performed on flies carrying the mutation immune deficiency (imd), which affects the humoral immune response [3], the treatment results in a striking decrease in resistance to infection. We therefore carried out a sensitized genetic screen to identify immunocompromised mutants by co-injecting beads and E. coli. From this screen, we identified a new gene we have named red shirt and identified the caspase Dredd as a regulator of the Drosophila immune response. The observation that mutants with defects in the humoral immune response are further immunocompromised by blocking phagocytosis, and thus inhibiting the cellular immune response, shows that the Drosophila cellular and humoral immune responses act in concert to fight infection.",

In Drosophila, three cecropin genes have previously been characterized, CecA1, CecA2, and CecB, in a dense cluster at 99E on the third chromosome. From the same locus, we now describe a fourth member of the cecropin gene family, CecC, which is mainly expressed at the early pupal stage. In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box. It consists of three shorter motifs, two of which are reminiscent of a putative promoter element in immune protein genes from the cecropia moth.",

Loss-of-function mutations in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. The link between microbial infections and activation of these two pathways has remained elusive. The Toll pathway is activated by Gram-positive bacteria through a circulating Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA).

Gram-positive bacteria and fungi predominantly induce the Toll signalling pathway, whereas Gram-negative bacteria activate the Imd pathway. Loss-of-function mutants in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. Genetic screens have identified a range of genes involved in these intracellular signalling cascades, but how they are activated by microbial infection is largely unknown. Activation of the transmembrane receptor Toll requires a proteolytically cleaved form of an extracellular cytokine-like polypeptide, Spätzle, suggesting that Toll does not itself function as a bona fide recognition receptor of microbial patterns. This is in apparent contrast with the mammalian Toll-like receptors and raises the question of which host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns to activate Toll through Spätzle. Here we present a mutation that blocks Toll activation by Gram-positive bacteria and significantly decreases resistance to this type of infection. The mutation semmelweis (seml) inactivates the gene encoding a peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). Interestingly, seml does not affect Toll activation by fungal infection, indicating the existence of a distinct recognition system for fungi to activate the Toll pathway.",

The defence against Gram-positive bacteria and natural fungal infections is mediated by the Toll signalling pathway, whereas defence against Gram-negative bacteria is dependent on the Immune deficiency (IMD) pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. The link between microbial infections and activation of these two pathways has remained elusive. The Toll pathway is activated by Gram-positive bacteria through a circulating Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). PGRPs appear to be highly conserved from insects to mammals, and the Drosophila genome contains 13 members. Here we report a mutation in a gene coding for a putative transmembrane protein, PGRP-LC, which reduces survival to Gram-negative sepsis but has no effect on the response to Gram-positive bacteria or natural fungal infections. By genetic epistasis, we demonstrate that PGRP-LC acts upstream of the imd gene. The data on PGRP-SA with respect to the response to Gram-positive infections, together with the present report, indicate that the PGRP family has a principal role in sensing microbial infections in Drosophila.",

From the same locus, we now describe a fourth member of the cecropin gene family, CecC, which is mainly expressed at the early pupal stage. In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box.

Here we report that Drosophila expresses 12 PGRP genes, distributed in 8 chromosomal loci on the 3 major chromosomes. By analyzing cDNA clones and genomic databases, we grouped them into two classes: PGRP-SA, SB1, SB2, SC1A, SC1B, SC2, and SD, with short transcripts and short 5'-untranslated regions; and PGRP-LA, LB, LC, LD, and LE, with long transcripts and long 5'-untranslated regions. The predicted structures indicate that the first group encodes extracellular proteins and the second group, intracellular and membrane-spanning proteins. Most PGRP genes are expressed in all postembryonic stages. Peptidoglycan injections strongly induce five of the genes. Transcripts from the different PGRP genes were found in immune competent organs such as fat body, gut, and hemocytes. We demonstrate that at least PGRP-SA and SC1B can bind peptidoglycan, and a function in immunity is likely for this family.",

Gram-positive bacteria and fungi predominantly induce the Toll signalling pathway, whereas Gram-negative bacteria activate the Imd pathway. Loss-of-function mutants in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. Genetic screens have identified a range of genes involved in these intracellular signalling cascades, but how they are activated by microbial infection is largely unknown. Activation of the transmembrane receptor Toll requires a proteolytically cleaved form of an extracellular cytokine-like polypeptide, Spätzle, suggesting that Toll does not itself function as a bona fide recognition receptor of microbial patterns. This is in apparent contrast with the mammalian Toll-like receptors and raises the question of which host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns to activate Toll through Spätzle. Here we present a mutation that blocks Toll activation by Gram-positive bacteria and significantly decreases resistance to this type of infection. The mutation semmelweis (seml) inactivates the gene encoding a peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). Interestingly, seml does not affect Toll activation by fungal infection, indicating the existence of a distinct recognition system for fungi to activate the Toll pathway.",

AttC is similar to the nearby AttA and AttB genes. AttD is more divergent and located on a different chromosome. Intriguingly, AttD may encode an intracellular attacin. DptB is linked in tandem to the closely related Diptericin. However, the DptB gene product contains a furin-like cleavage site and may be processed in an attacin-like fashion. All attacin and diptericin genes are induced after bacterial challenge. This induction is reduced in imd mutants, and unexpectedly also in Tl(-) mutants.

Consistent with this, we noted that PGRP-SD mutants were susceptible to some Gram-positive bacteria and that a loss-of-function mutation in PGRP-SD severely exacerbated the PGRP-SA and GNBP1 mutant phenotypes.

In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box.

Consistent with this, we noted that PGRP-SD mutants were susceptible to some Gram-positive bacteria and that a loss-of-function mutation in PGRP-SD severely exacerbated the PGRP-SA and GNBP1 mutant phenotypes.

A peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRP, has been cloned from moths as well as vertebrates and has been shown to participate in peptidoglycan-mediated activation of prophenoloxidase in the silk moth. Here we report that Drosophila expresses 12 PGRP genes, distributed in 8 chromosomal loci on the 3 major chromosomes. By analyzing cDNA clones and genomic databases, we grouped them into two classes: PGRP-SA, SB1, SB2, SC1A, SC1B, SC2, and SD, with short transcripts and short 5'-untranslated regions; and PGRP-LA, LB, LC, LD, and LE, with long transcripts and long 5'-untranslated regions. The predicted structures indicate that the first group encodes extracellular proteins and the second group, intracellular and membrane-spanning proteins. Most PGRP genes are expressed in all postembryonic stages. Peptidoglycan injections strongly induce five of the genes. Transcripts from the different PGRP genes were found in immune competent organs such as fat body, gut, and hemocytes. We demonstrate that at least PGRP-SA and SC1B can bind peptidoglycan, and a function in immunity is likely for this family.",

Gram-positive bacteria and fungi predominantly induce the Toll signalling pathway, whereas Gram-negative bacteria activate the Imd pathway. Loss-of-function mutants in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. Genetic screens have identified a range of genes involved in these intracellular signalling cascades, but how they are activated by microbial infection is largely unknown. Activation of the transmembrane receptor Toll requires a proteolytically cleaved form of an extracellular cytokine-like polypeptide, Spätzle, suggesting that Toll does not itself function as a bona fide recognition receptor of microbial patterns. This is in apparent contrast with the mammalian Toll-like receptors and raises the question of which host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns to activate Toll through Spätzle. Here we present a mutation that blocks Toll activation by Gram-positive bacteria and significantly decreases resistance to this type of infection. The mutation semmelweis (seml) inactivates the gene encoding a peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). Interestingly, seml does not affect Toll activation by fungal infection, indicating the existence of a distinct recognition system for fungi to activate the Toll pathway.",

It is not clear how binding of peptidoglycan to the extracellular domain of PGRP-LC activates intracellular signaling because its cytoplasmic domain has no homology to characterized proteins. Here, we demonstrate that PGRP-LC binds Imd and that its cytoplasmic domain is critical for its activity, suggesting that PGRP-LC acts as a signal-transducing receptor. The PGRP-LC cytoplasmic domain is also essential for the formation of dimers, and results suggest that dimerization may be required for receptor activation.

This response is manifested by the appearance of a specialized subset of blood cells, the lamellocytes, which are the key players in the encapsulation and killing of the parasite. The formation of lamellocytes involves the activation of the Toll, the Jun kinase and the JAK/STAT pathways however the minimal requirement for initiation of lamellocyte development in the course of the cellular immune response has not been defined yet. In this study, we tested whether or not the mechanical injury itself, caused by oviposition, could provide a sufficient signal for lamellocyte development. We found that sterile wounding, comparable to that occurring during oviposition, induces normal lamellocyte development. We propose therefore that mechanical damage of the cuticle and subsequent disruption of the basal lamina is a minimal and sufficient single signal for normal lamellocyte development in the course of the cellular immune response of Drosophila.",

One of these peptides, drosomycin, is active primarily against fungi. Using a drosomycin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene, we now show that in addition to the fat body, a variety of epithelial tissues that are in direct contact with the external environment, including those of the respiratory, digestive and reproductive tracts, can express the antifungal peptide, suggesting a local response to infections affecting these barrier tissues. As is the case for vertebrate epithelia, insect epithelia appear to be more than passive physical barriers and are likely to constitute an active component of innate immunity. We also show that, in contrast to the systemic antifungal response, this local immune response is independent of the Toll pathway.",

By comparison of their sequences, we found that the dptlp gene has all of the functional domains conserved in the diptericin gene and other anti-bacterial proteins.

         "The rel/NF-kappa B-related morphogen dorsal is a maternally expressed gene which is involved in the control of the dorso-ventral axis during early embryogenesis of Drosophila. We show that this gene is also expressed in the fat body of larvae and adults of Drosophila as well as in a tumorous blood cell line: its expression is noticeably enhanced upon bacterial (or lipopolysaccharide) challenge. This challenge also induces within 15-30 min a nuclear translocation of the dorsal protein. The genes encoding inducible antibacterial peptides in Drosophila contain kappa B-related nucleotide sequences and we show that the dorsal protein can bind to such motifs and sequence-specifically transactivate a reporter gene in co-transfection experiments with a Drosophila cell line. However, in dl1 mutants, in the absence of dorsal protein, the genes encoding antibacterial peptides retain their inducibility, suggesting a multifactorial control. The results indicate that in addition to its role in embryogenesis, dorsal is involved in the immune response of Drosophila. They also strengthen the analogy between the mammalian acute phase response and the insect immune response.",

         "Drosophila has highly efficient defenses against infection. These include both cellular immune responses, such as the phagocytosis of invading microorganisms, and humoral immune responses, such as the secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the hemolymph [1] [2]. These defense systems are thought to interact, but the nature and extent of these interactions is not known. Here we describe a method for inhibiting phagocytosis in Drosophila blood cells (hemocytes) by injecting polystyrene beads into the body cavity. This treatment does not in itself make a fly susceptible to Escherichia coli infection. However, when performed on flies carrying the mutation immune deficiency (imd), which affects the humoral immune response [3], the treatment results in a striking decrease in resistance to infection. We therefore carried out a sensitized genetic screen to identify immunocompromised mutants by co-injecting beads and E. coli. From this screen, we identified a new gene we have named red shirt and identified the caspase Dredd as a regulator of the Drosophila immune response. The observation that mutants with defects in the humoral immune response are further immunocompromised by blocking phagocytosis, and thus inhibiting the cellular immune response, shows that the Drosophila cellular and humoral immune responses act in concert to fight infection.",

In Drosophila, three cecropin genes have previously been characterized, CecA1, CecA2, and CecB, in a dense cluster at 99E on the third chromosome. From the same locus, we now describe a fourth member of the cecropin gene family, CecC, which is mainly expressed at the early pupal stage. In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box. It consists of three shorter motifs, two of which are reminiscent of a putative promoter element in immune protein genes from the cecropia moth.",

The defence against Gram-positive bacteria and natural fungal infections is mediated by the Toll signalling pathway, whereas defence against Gram-negative bacteria is dependent on the Immune deficiency (IMD) pathway. Loss-of-function mutations in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. The link between microbial infections and activation of these two pathways has remained elusive. The Toll pathway is activated by Gram-positive bacteria through a circulating Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). PGRPs appear to be highly conserved from insects to mammals, and the Drosophila genome contains 13 members. Here we report a mutation in a gene coding for a putative transmembrane protein, PGRP-LC, which reduces survival to Gram-negative sepsis but has no effect on the response to Gram-positive bacteria or natural fungal infections. By genetic epistasis, we demonstrate that PGRP-LC acts upstream of the imd gene. The data on PGRP-SA with respect to the response to Gram-positive infections, together with the present report, indicate that the PGRP family has a principal role in sensing microbial infections in Drosophila.",

Gram-positive bacteria and fungi predominantly induce the Toll signalling pathway, whereas Gram-negative bacteria activate the Imd pathway. Loss-of-function mutants in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. Genetic screens have identified a range of genes involved in these intracellular signalling cascades, but how they are activated by microbial infection is largely unknown. Activation of the transmembrane receptor Toll requires a proteolytically cleaved form of an extracellular cytokine-like polypeptide, Spätzle, suggesting that Toll does not itself function as a bona fide recognition receptor of microbial patterns. This is in apparent contrast with the mammalian Toll-like receptors and raises the question of which host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns to activate Toll through Spätzle. Here we present a mutation that blocks Toll activation by Gram-positive bacteria and significantly decreases resistance to this type of infection. The mutation semmelweis (seml) inactivates the gene encoding a peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). Interestingly, seml does not affect Toll activation by fungal infection, indicating the existence of a distinct recognition system for fungi to activate the Toll pathway.",

From the same locus, we now describe a fourth member of the cecropin gene family, CecC, which is mainly expressed at the early pupal stage. In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box. It consists of three shorter motifs, two of which are reminiscent of a putative promoter element in immune protein genes from the cecropia moth.",

Here we report that Drosophila expresses 12 PGRP genes, distributed in 8 chromosomal loci on the 3 major chromosomes. By analyzing cDNA clones and genomic databases, we grouped them into two classes: PGRP-SA, SB1, SB2, SC1A, SC1B, SC2, and SD, with short transcripts and short 5'-untranslated regions; and PGRP-LA, LB, LC, LD, and LE, with long transcripts and long 5'-untranslated regions. The predicted structures indicate that the first group encodes extracellular proteins and the second group, intracellular and membrane-spanning proteins. Most PGRP genes are expressed in all postembryonic stages. Peptidoglycan injections strongly induce five of the genes. Transcripts from the different PGRP genes were found in immune competent organs such as fat body, gut, and hemocytes. We demonstrate that at least PGRP-SA and SC1B can bind peptidoglycan, and a function in immunity is likely for this family.",

Gram-positive bacteria and fungi predominantly induce the Toll signalling pathway, whereas Gram-negative bacteria activate the Imd pathway. Loss-of-function mutants in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. Genetic screens have identified a range of genes involved in these intracellular signalling cascades, but how they are activated by microbial infection is largely unknown. Activation of the transmembrane receptor Toll requires a proteolytically cleaved form of an extracellular cytokine-like polypeptide, Spätzle, suggesting that Toll does not itself function as a bona fide recognition receptor of microbial patterns. This is in apparent contrast with the mammalian Toll-like receptors and raises the question of which host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns to activate Toll through Spätzle. Here we present a mutation that blocks Toll activation by Gram-positive bacteria and significantly decreases resistance to this type of infection. The mutation semmelweis (seml) inactivates the gene encoding a peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). Interestingly, seml does not affect Toll activation by fungal infection, indicating the existence of a distinct recognition system for fungi to activate the Toll pathway.",

AttC is similar to the nearby AttA and AttB genes. AttD is more divergent and located on a different chromosome. Intriguingly, AttD may encode an intracellular attacin. DptB is linked in tandem to the closely related Diptericin. However, the DptB gene product contains a furin-like cleavage site and may be processed in an attacin-like fashion. All attacin and diptericin genes are induced after bacterial challenge. This induction is reduced in imd mutants, and unexpectedly also in Tl(-) mutants.

In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box.

A peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRP, has been cloned from moths as well as vertebrates and has been shown to participate in peptidoglycan-mediated activation of prophenoloxidase in the silk moth. Here we report that Drosophila expresses 12 PGRP genes, distributed in 8 chromosomal loci on the 3 major chromosomes. By analyzing cDNA clones and genomic databases, we grouped them into two classes: PGRP-SA, SB1, SB2, SC1A, SC1B, SC2, and SD, with short transcripts and short 5'-untranslated regions; and PGRP-LA, LB, LC, LD, and LE, with long transcripts and long 5'-untranslated regions. The predicted structures indicate that the first group encodes extracellular proteins and the second group, intracellular and membrane-spanning proteins. Most PGRP genes are expressed in all postembryonic stages. Peptidoglycan injections strongly induce five of the genes. Transcripts from the different PGRP genes were found in immune competent organs such as fat body, gut, and hemocytes. We demonstrate that at least PGRP-SA and SC1B can bind peptidoglycan, and a function in immunity is likely for this family.",

Gram-positive bacteria and fungi predominantly induce the Toll signalling pathway, whereas Gram-negative bacteria activate the Imd pathway. Loss-of-function mutants in either pathway reduce the resistance to corresponding infections. Genetic screens have identified a range of genes involved in these intracellular signalling cascades, but how they are activated by microbial infection is largely unknown. Activation of the transmembrane receptor Toll requires a proteolytically cleaved form of an extracellular cytokine-like polypeptide, Spätzle, suggesting that Toll does not itself function as a bona fide recognition receptor of microbial patterns. This is in apparent contrast with the mammalian Toll-like receptors and raises the question of which host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns to activate Toll through Spätzle. Here we present a mutation that blocks Toll activation by Gram-positive bacteria and significantly decreases resistance to this type of infection. The mutation semmelweis (seml) inactivates the gene encoding a peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-SA). Interestingly, seml does not affect Toll activation by fungal infection, indicating the existence of a distinct recognition system for fungi to activate the Toll pathway.",

It is not clear how binding of peptidoglycan to the extracellular domain of PGRP-LC activates intracellular signaling because its cytoplasmic domain has no homology to characterized proteins. Here, we demonstrate that PGRP-LC binds Imd and that its cytoplasmic domain is critical for its activity, suggesting that PGRP-LC acts as a signal-transducing receptor. The PGRP-LC cytoplasmic domain is also essential for the formation of dimers, and results suggest that dimerization may be required for receptor activation. The PGRP-LC cytoplasmic domain can mediate formation of heterodimers between different PGRP-LC isoforms, thereby potentially expanding the diversity of ligands that can be recognized by the receptor.",

This response is manifested by the appearance of a specialized subset of blood cells, the lamellocytes, which are the key players in the encapsulation and killing of the parasite. The formation of lamellocytes involves the activation of the Toll, the Jun kinase and the JAK/STAT pathways however the minimal requirement for initiation of lamellocyte development in the course of the cellular immune response has not been defined yet. In this study, we tested whether or not the mechanical injury itself, caused by oviposition, could provide a sufficient signal for lamellocyte development. We found that sterile wounding, comparable to that occurring during oviposition, induces normal lamellocyte development. We propose therefore that mechanical damage of the cuticle and subsequent disruption of the basal lamina is a minimal and sufficient single signal for normal lamellocyte development in the course of the cellular immune response of Drosophila.",

The diaminopimelic acid (DAP)-type peptidoglycan potently activates imd-dependent induction of antibacterial peptides. Peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) family members act as pattern recognition molecules. PGRP-LC loss-of-function mutations affect the imd-dependent induction of antibacterial peptides and resistance to Gram-negative bacteria, whereas PGRP-LE binds to the DAP-type peptidoglycan, and a gain-of-function mutation induces constitutive activation of both the imd pathway and melanization. Here, we generated PGRP-LE null mutants and report that PGRP-LE functions synergistically with PGRP-LC in producing resistance to Escherichia coli and Bacillus megaterium infections, which have the DAP-type peptidoglycan. Consistent with this, PGRP-LE acts both upstream and in parallel with PGRP-LC in the imd pathway, and is required for infection-dependent activation of melanization in Drosophila. A role for PGRP-LE in the epithelial induction of antimicrobial peptides is also suggested.",

One of these peptides, drosomycin, is active primarily against fungi. Using a drosomycin-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene, we now show that in addition to the fat body, a variety of epithelial tissues that are in direct contact with the external environment, including those of the respiratory, digestive and reproductive tracts, can express the antifungal peptide, suggesting a local response to infections affecting these barrier tissues. As is the case for vertebrate epithelia, insect epithelia appear to be more than passive physical barriers and are likely to constitute an active component of innate immunity. We also show that, in contrast to the systemic antifungal response, this local immune response is independent of the Toll pathway.",

In all, 6713 dsRNAs from an S2 cell-derived cDNA library were analyzed for their effect on Attacin promoter activity in response to Escherichia coli. We identified seven gene products required for the Attacin response in vitro, including two novel Imd pathway components: inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (Iap2) and transforming growth factor-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein (TAB). Iap2 is required for antimicrobial peptide response also by the fat body in vivo. Both these factors function downstream of Imd. Neither TAB nor Iap2 is required for Relish cleavage, but may be involved in Relish nuclear localization in vitro, suggesting a novel mode of regulation of the Imd pathway.

We performed a large-scale RNAi screen to identify novel components of the Imd pathway in Drosophila S2 cells. In all, 6713 dsRNAs from an S2 cell-derived cDNA library were analyzed for their effect on Attacin promoter activity in response to Escherichia coli. We identified seven gene products required for the Attacin response in vitro, including two novel Imd pathway components: inhibitor of apoptosis 2 (Iap2) and transforming growth factor-activated kinase 1 (TAK1)-binding protein (TAB). Iap2 is required for antimicrobial peptide response also by the fat body in vivo. Both these factors function downstream of Imd. Neither TAB nor Iap2 is required for Relish cleavage, but may be involved in Relish nuclear localization in vitro, suggesting a novel mode of regulation of the Imd pathway. Our results show that an RNAi-based approach is suitable to identify genes in conserved signaling cascades.",

Mutations in ird5 prevent induction of six antibacterial peptide genes in response to infection but do not affect the induction of an antifungal peptide gene. Consistent with this finding, Escherichia coli survive 100 times better in ird5 adults than in wild-type animals. The ird5 gene encodes a Drosophila homolog of mammalian IkappaB kinases (IKKs). The ird5 phenotype and sequence suggest that the gene is specifically required for the activation of Relish, a Drosophila NF-kappaB family member.",

We show that this gene is also expressed in the fat body of larvae and adults of Drosophila as well as in a tumorous blood cell line: its expression is noticeably enhanced upon bacterial (or lipopolysaccharide) challenge. This challenge also induces within 15-30 min a nuclear translocation of the dorsal protein. The genes encoding inducible antibacterial peptides in Drosophila contain kappa B-related nucleotide sequences and we show that the dorsal protein can bind to such motifs and sequence-specifically transactivate a reporter gene in co-transfection experiments with a Drosophila cell line. However, in dl1 mutants, in the absence of dorsal protein, the genes encoding antibacterial peptides retain their inducibility, suggesting a multifactorial control. The results indicate that in addition to its role in embryogenesis, dorsal is involved in the immune response of Drosophila. They also strengthen the analogy between the mammalian acute phase response and the insect immune response.",

         "Drosophila has highly efficient defenses against infection. These include both cellular immune responses, such as the phagocytosis of invading microorganisms, and humoral immune responses, such as the secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the hemolymph [1] [2]. These defense systems are thought to interact, but the nature and extent of these interactions is not known. Here we describe a method for inhibiting phagocytosis in Drosophila blood cells (hemocytes) by injecting polystyrene beads into the body cavity. This treatment does not in itself make a fly susceptible to Escherichia coli infection. However, when performed on flies carrying the mutation immune deficiency (imd), which affects the humoral immune response [3], the treatment results in a striking decrease in resistance to infection. We therefore carried out a sensitized genetic screen to identify immunocompromised mutants by co-injecting beads and E. coli. From this screen, we identified a new gene we have named red shirt and identified the caspase Dredd as a regulator of the Drosophila immune response. The observation that mutants with defects in the humoral immune response are further immunocompromised by blocking phagocytosis, and thus inhibiting the cellular immune response, shows that the Drosophila cellular and humoral immune responses act in concert to fight infection.",
