3347,Rizki RM;Rizki TM,Cell interactions in the differentiation of a melanotic tumor in Drosophila.,111992,12,3,"The cellular events in the formation of melanotic tumors in the tu-W mutant larva of Drosophila melanogaster are described. The first step is the differentiation of spherical hemocytes to flattened cells, the lamellocyte variants. Subsequently, the surface of the caudal fat body undergoes changes to which the hemocytes respond by forming cellular capsules. The hemocytes utilize two mechanisms in this process: (1) phagocytosis of small particulate materials escaping from the adipose cells, (2) adhesion to form a multilayered wall of lamellocytes. Differentiating hemocytes in the vicinity of the tumor-forming site extrude membrane-bound vesicles that tend to adhere to the hemocyte surfaces. These vesicles are trapped between the lamellocytes as they pile in layers to form the capsule wall. It is suggested that the vesicles play a role in lamellocyte-to-lamellocyte adhesion during the initial stages of hemocyte aggregation at the tumor-forming site.",1979,Differentiation; research in biological diversity,3.39,Rizki RM,Rizki TM,,
1987,Leulier F;Lhocine N;Lemaitre B;Meier P,The Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein DIAP2 functions in innate immunity and is essential to resist gram-negative bacterial infection.,16894030,26,21,"The founding member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family was originally identified as a cell death inhibitor. However, recent evidence suggests that IAPs are multifunctional signaling devices that influence diverse biological processes. To investigate the in vivo function of Drosophila melanogaster IAP2, we have generated diap2 null alleles. diap2 mutant animals develop normally and are fully viable, suggesting that diap2 is dispensable for proper development. However, these animals were acutely sensitive to infection by gram-negative bacteria. In Drosophila, infection by gram-negative bacteria triggers the innate immune response by activating the immune deficiency (imd) signaling cascade, a NF-kappaB-dependent pathway that shares striking similarities with the pathway of mammalian tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1). diap2 mutant flies failed to activate NF-kappaB-mediated expression of antibacterial peptide genes and, consequently, rapidly succumbed to bacterial infection. Our genetic epistasis analysis places diap2 downstream of or in parallel to imd, Dredd, Tak1, and Relish. Therefore, DIAP2 functions in the host immune response to gram-negative bacteria. In contrast, we find that the Drosophila TNFR-associated factor (Traf) family member Traf2 is dispensable in resistance to gram-negative bacterial infection. Taken together, our genetic data identify DIAP2 as an essential component of the Imd signaling cascade, protecting the organism from infiltrating microbes.",2006,Molecular and cellular biology,5.3,Leulier F,Meier P,"The Breakthrough Toby Robins Breast Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Research, London SW3 6JB, UK. francois.leulier@icr.ac.uk",UK

In Drosophila, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal-induced activation of the Rel/NF-kappaB family transcription factors is an essential step in the transcriptional activation of inducible antimicrobial peptide genes. However, the mechanism by which the LPS-induced signaling pathway proceeds remains largely unknown. Here we have cloned a novel Drosophila LPS-activated kinase (DLAK) that is structurally related to mammalian IkappaB kinases. DLAK is expressed and transiently activated in LPS-responsive Drosophila cells following LPS stimulation. Furthermore, DLAK can interact with Cactus, a Drosophila IkappaB and phosphorylate recombinant Cactus, in vitro. Overexpression of dominant-negative mutant DLAK (DLAK(K50A)) blocks LPS-induced Cactus degradation. DLAK-bound Cactus can be degraded in a LPS signal-dependent fashion, whereas the DLAK(K50A) mutant-bound Cactus is completely resistant to degradation in the presence of LPS. The DLAK(K50A) mutant also inhibits nuclear kappaB binding activity and kappaB-dependent diptericin reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner, but the kappaB-dependent diptericin reporter gene activity can be rescued by overexpression of wild type DLAK. Moreover, mRNA analysis of various kappaB-dependent antimicrobial peptide genes shows that LPS inducibility of these genes is greatly impaired in cells overexpressing DLAK(K50A). These results establish that DLAK is a novel LPS-activated kinase, which is an essential signaling component for the induction of antimicrobial peptide genes following LPS treatment in Drosophila cells.",2000,The Journal of biological chemistry,4.8,Kim YS,Lee WJ,"Laboratory of Immunology, Medical Research Center, College of Medicine, Yonsei University, Shinchon-Dong 134, Seoul, South Korea.",South Korea
2649,Tingvall TO;Roos E;Engström Y,The GATA factor Serpent is required for the onset of the humoral immune response in Drosophila embryos.,11274409,98,7,"Innate immunity in Drosophila is characterized by the inducible expression of antimicrobial peptides. We have investigated the development and regulation of immune responsiveness in Drosophila embryos after infection. Immune competence, as monitored by the induction of Cecropin A1-lacZ constructs, was observed first in the embryonic yolk. This observation suggests that the yolk plays an important role in the humoral immune response of the developing embryo by synthesizing antimicrobial peptides. Around midembryogenesis, the response in the yolk was diminished. Simultaneously, Cecropin expression became inducible in a large number of cells in the epidermis, demonstrating that late-stage embryos can synthesize their own antibiotics in the epidermis. This production likely serves to provide the hatching larva with an active antimicrobial barrier and protection against systemic infections. Cecropin expression in the yolk required the presence of a GATA site in the promoter as well as the involvement of the GATA-binding transcription factor Serpent (dGATAb). In contrast, neither the GATA site nor Serpent were necessary for Cecropin expression in the epidermis. Thus, the inducible immune responses in the yolk and in the epidermis can be uncoupled and call for distinct sets of transcription factors. Our data suggest that Serpent is involved in the distinction between a systemic response in the yolk/fat body and a local immune response in epithelial cells. In addition, the present study shows that signal transduction pathways controlling innate and epithelial defense reactions can be dissected genetically in Drosophila embryos.",2001,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,11.1,Tingvall TO,Engström Y,"Department of Molecular Biology and Functional Genomics, Arrhenius Laboratories for Natural Sciences, Stockholm University, S-106 91 Stockholm, Sweden.",Sweden

Six genes were identified, including two that encode previously known Dorsal-interacting proteins (Twist and Cactus), three that encode novel proteins, and one that encodes Drosophila Ubc9 (DmUbc9), a protein thought to conjugate the ubiquitin-like polypeptide Smt3 to protein substrates. We have found that DmUbc9 binds and conjugates Drosophila Smt3 (DmSmt3) to Dorsal. In cultured cells, DmUbc9 was found to relieve inhibition of Dorsal nuclear uptake by Cactus, allowing Dorsal to enter the nucleus and activate transcription. The effect of DmUbc9 on Dorsal activity was potentiated by the overexpression of DmSmt3. We have also identified a DmSmt3-activating enzyme, DmSAE1/DmSAE2 and found that it further potentiates Dorsal-mediated activation.",2000,The Journal of biological chemistry,4.8,Bhaskar V,Courey AJ,"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095-1569, USA.",USA

Until now however, the molecular recognition proceedings for sensing of Gram-positive pathogens were not known. In the present, we report the physical interaction between GNBP1 and PGRP-SA using recombinant proteins. GNBP1 was able to hydrolyze Gram-positive peptidoglycan (PG), while PGRP-SA bound highly purified PG fragments (muropeptides). Interaction between these proteins was enhanced in the presence of PG or muropeptides. PGRP-SA binding depended on the polymerization status of the muropeptides, pointing to constraints in the number of PGRP-SA molecules bound for signaling initiation. We propose a model whereby GNBP1 presents a processed form of PG for sensing by PGRP-SA and that a tripartite interaction between these proteins and PG is essential for downstream signaling.",2006,The EMBO journal,11.4,Wang L,Ligoxygakis P,"Genetics Unit, Department of Biochemistry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.",UK

To gain insight into the role of ird1 in the immune response, we examine how amino acid starvation affects the immune signalling pathways in Drosophila. Starvation, in the absence of infection, leads to expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes and this response is dependent on ird1 and the Imd immune signalling pathway. Starvation, in addition to bacterial infection, suppresses the AMP response in wild-type animals and reduces the ability to survive M. luteus infection. Our results suggest that starvation and innate immune signalling may be intimately linked processes.",2007,Cellular microbiology,3.4,Wu J,Wu LP,"Center for Biosystems Research, University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, 5115 Plant Sciences Bldg., College Park, MD 20742, USA.",USA

Survival rates post-infection, after a fungal or bacterial infection, varied according to the combination of signaling pathway (Toll and Imd) and sex tested.

Drosophila uses two distinct immune signaling pathways, the Toll and immune deficiency (Imd) pathways, to respond to different classes of microbes. The Toll pathway is predominantly activated by Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, while the Imd pathway is primarily activated by Gram-negative bacteria. Recent work has suggested that this differential activation is achieved through peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-mediated recognition of specific forms of peptidoglycan (PG). In this study, we have further analyzed the specific PG molecular requirements for Imd activation through the pattern recognition receptor PGRP-LC in both cultured cell line and in flies. We found that two signatures of Gram-negative PG, the presence of diaminopimelic acid in the peptide bridge and a 1,6-anhydro form of N-acetylmuramic acid in the glycan chain, allow discrimination between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Our results also point to a role for PG oligomerization in Imd activation, and we demonstrate that elements of both the sugar backbone and the peptide bridge of PG are required for optimum recognition. Altogether, these results indicate multiple requirements for efficient PG-mediated activation of the Imd pathway and demonstrate that PG is a complex immune elicitor.",2004,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",4.4,Stenbak CR,Mengin-Lecreulx D,"Centre de Génétique Moléculaire du Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Gif-sur-Yvette, France.",France

Recently, the immune function of PO has been challenged. We tested how PO is activated following injury in 2 insects, i.e. the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the wax moth Galleria mellonella. Rapid PO activation in Drosophila was limited to discrete areas of the hemolymph clot which forms after injury. Surprisingly, unlike systemic PO activation during bacterial sepsis, clot melanization was not sensitive to microbial elicitors in our assay. Instead, Drosophila clot melanization was activated by endogenous signals such as apoptotic cells and was superinduced by phosphatidylserine, a negatively charged phospholipid normally found on the inner surface of the plasma membrane and exposed during apoptosis. In contrast, melanization in G. mellonella hemolymph was stronger and more uniform and was sensitive to peptidoglycan. This shows that both exogenous and endogenous signals can trigger the same immune mechanism in species- and context-dependent ways. Our findings have implications for the evolutionary dynamics of immune mechanisms and are in agreement with recent comparisons of insect immune transcriptomes.",2009,Journal of innate immunity,5.3,Bidla G,Theopold U,"Department of Molecular Biology and Functional Genomics, University of Stockholm, Stockholm, Sweden.",Sweden

The MAP kinases and the IKK-NF-kappa B molecules play important roles in the initiation of immune effector responses. We have found that the Drosophila NF-kappa B protein Relish plays a crucial role in limiting the duration of JNK activation and output in response to Gram-negative infections. Relish activation is linked to proteasomal degradation of TAK1, the upstream MAP kinase kinase kinase required for JNK activation. Degradation of TAK1 leads to a rapid termination of JNK signaling, resulting in a transient JNK-dependent response that precedes the sustained induction of Relish-dependent innate immune loci. Because the IKK-NF-kappa B module also negatively regulates JNK activation in mammals, thereby controlling inflammation-induced apoptosis, the regulatory cross-talk between the JNK and NF-kappa B pathways appears to be broadly conserved.",2004,Genes & development,10.5,Park JM,Wasserman SA,"Laboratory of Gene Regulation and Signal Transduction, Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, 92093-0636, USA.",USA

Despite its role in promoting pathogen resistance, inappropriate activation and expression of NFkappaB and other immunity-related effector molecules can lead to cancer, inflammation, and other diseases of aging. Understanding the mechanisms leading to immune system activation as well as the short- and long-term consequences of such activation on health and lifespan is therefore critical for the development of beneficial immuno-modulating and longevity-promoting interventions. Mechanisms of innate immunity are highly conserved across species, and we take advantage of genetic tools in the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to study the effects of acute and chronic activation of immunity pathways on pathogen resistance and general fitness of adult flies. Our findings indicate that fat body specific overexpression of a putative pathogen recognition molecule, peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-LE), is sufficient for constitutive up-regulation of the immune response and for enhanced pathogen resistance. Primary components of fitness are unaffected by acute activation, but chronic activation leads to an inflammatory state and reduced lifespan.

Nevertheless, their contribution to fighting off infection has not been seriously addressed.

We present three infection protocols (i.e., injection, rolling, ingestion) that introduce Aspergillus either directly into the hemolymph or at different epithelial surfaces of Toll-deficient Drosophila flies. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate attenuated virulence of known hypovirulent Aspergillus strains and protection of Aspergillus-infected flies given oral Aspergillus-active agents such is voriconazole. These protocols can be adapted for similar studies of other fungal pathogens. Crossing and generation of Toll-deficient Drosophila flies takes 3 weeks; Aspergillus conidial preparation takes 3 days; fly inoculation depending on the infection assay takes 1 to 6-8 hours; and assessment of fly survival, Aspergillus strain virulence, Drosophila innate host parameters and/or drug activity takes 4-8 days.",2010,Virulence,5.2,Lionakis MS,Kontoyiannis DP,"Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.",USA

These include both cellular immune responses, such as the phagocytosis of invading microorganisms, and humoral immune responses, such as the secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the hemolymph [1] [2]. These defense systems are thought to interact, but the nature and extent of these interactions is not known. Here we describe a method for inhibiting phagocytosis in Drosophila blood cells (hemocytes) by injecting polystyrene beads into the body cavity. This treatment does not in itself make a fly susceptible to Escherichia coli infection. However, when performed on flies carrying the mutation immune deficiency (imd), which affects the humoral immune response [3], the treatment results in a striking decrease in resistance to infection. We therefore carried out a sensitized genetic screen to identify immunocompromised mutants by co-injecting beads and E. coli. From this screen, we identified a new gene we have named red shirt and identified the caspase Dredd as a regulator of the Drosophila immune response. The observation that mutants with defects in the humoral immune response are further immunocompromised by blocking phagocytosis, and thus inhibiting the cellular immune response, shows that the Drosophila cellular and humoral immune responses act in concert to fight infection.",2000,Current biology : CB,9.2,Elrod-Erickson M,Schneider D,"Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA.",USA

Expression cloning was used to isolate from L2 cells a cDNA that encodes a third class (class C) of scavenger receptor, Drosophila SR-CI (dSR-CI). dSR-CI expression was restricted to macrophages/hemocytes during embryonic development. When expressed in mammalian cells, dSR-CI exhibited high affinity and saturable binding of 125I-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein and mediated its chloroquine-dependent, presumably lysosomal, degradation.

Here we show a dramatic effect in the context of cellular immunity where, unlike embryonic development, Rac2 appears to have a non-redundant function. When an invading parasitoid is recognized as foreign, circulating hemocytes (blood cells) should recognize and attach to the egg chorion. After attachment the hemocytes should then spread to form a multilayered capsule surrounding the invader. In Rac2 mutants this process is disrupted. Immune surveillance cells, known as plasmatocytes, adhere to the parasitoid egg but fail to spread, and septate junctions do not assemble, possibly due to mislocalization of the Protein 4.1 homolog Coracle. Finally, larger cells known as lamellocytes attach to the capsule but also fail to spread, and there is a lack of melanization.

Previous studies in a Drosophila melanogaster model showed that binding of ACP to the sulfated polysaccharide chains (glycosaminoglycans) of HSPGs promotes host death and is associated with higher bacterial burdens. We hypothesized that ACP-glycosaminoglycan binding might determine infection outcome by altering host responses to infection, such as expression of antimicrobial peptides. As glycosaminoglycans/HSPGs also interact with a number of endogenous secreted signaling molecules in Drosophila, we examined the effects of host and pathogen glycosaminoglycan/HSPG-binding structures in host survival of infection and antimicrobial peptide expression. Strikingly, host survival after infection with wild-type streptococci was enhanced among flies overexpressing the endogenous glycosaminoglycan/HSPG-binding morphogen Decapentaplegic-a transforming growth factor β-like Drosophila homolog of mammalian bone morphogenetic proteins-but not by flies overexpressing a mutant, non-glycosaminoglycan-binding Decapentaplegic, or the other endogenous glycosaminoglycan/HSPG-binding morphogens, Hedgehog and Wingless. While ACP-glycosaminoglycan binding was associated with enhanced transcription of peptidoglycan recognition proteins and antimicrobial peptides, Decapentaplegic overexpression suppressed transcription of these genes during streptococcal infection. Further, the glycosaminoglycan-binding domain of ACP competed with Decapentaplegic for binding to the soluble glycosaminoglycan heparin in an in vitro assay. These data suggest that, in addition to promoting bacterial entry into host cells, ACP competes with Decapentaplegic for binding to glycosaminoglycans/HSPGs during infection and that these bacterial and endogenous glycosaminoglycan-binding structures determine host survival and regulate antimicrobial peptide transcription.",2011,Infection and immunity,3.1,Wang Z,Baron MJ,"Channing Laboratory, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, 181 Longwood Avenue, Boston, MA 02115, USA.",USA

Whereas the mechanisms leading to the production of ROS are rather well delineated, the mechanisms underlying tissue susceptibility or tolerance to oxidant stress remain elusive. Through an experimental selection over many generations, we have previously generated Drosophila melanogaster flies that tolerate tremendous oxidant stress and have shown that the family of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is over-represented in these tolerant flies. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that overexpression of even one AMP at a time (e.g. Diptericin) allows wild-type flies to survive much better in hyperoxia. In this study, we used a number of experimental approaches to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying hyperoxia tolerance in flies with AMP overexpression. We demonstrate that flies with Diptericin overexpression resist oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and preventing an increase in ROS levels after hyperoxia. Depleting the GSH pool using buthionine sulfoximine limits fly survival, thus confirming that enhanced survival observed in these flies is related to improved redox homeostasis. We conclude that 1) AMPs play an important role in tolerance to oxidant stress, 2) overexpression of Diptericin changes the cellular redox balance between oxidant and antioxidant, and 3) this change in redox balance plays an important role in survival in hyperoxia.",2011,The Journal of biological chemistry,4.8,Zhao HW,Haddad GG,"Division of Respiratory Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.",USA

Transglutaminase is the only mammalian clotting factor found in Drosophila, and as it acts in coagulation in other invertebrates, it is also likely to be important in clotting in Drosophila. Here we describe a Fondue-GFP fusion construct that labels the cuticle and clot, and show that chemical inhibition and RNAi knockdown of the Drosophila transglutaminase gene affect clot properties and composition in ways similar to knockdown of the fon gene. Thus, Fondue appears to be incorporated into the cuticle and is a key transglutaminase substrate in the clot.

What is unclear is exactly how this regulation occurs. To further elucidate this interaction we examined the activities of Rac1 and Rho1 in Drosophila cellular immune surveillance cells. In larvae the cellular immune response involves circulating cells (hemocytes) that can be recruited from a hematopoietic organ located behind the brain, as well as a sessile population found just underneath the larval cuticle. We demonstrate for the first time that Rho-kinase activation requires both Rho1 and the Drosophila c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Basket). We also show that Rac1, via Basket, regulates Rho1 activity, possibly by inhibiting RhoGAPp190. In the reciprocal pathway, co-expression of dominant negative Rho-kinase and constitutive active Rho1 induces a Rac1-like phenotype. This induction requires the formin Diaphanous. Co-expression of dominant negative Rho-kinase and constitutive active Rho1 also induces filopodia formation, with Diaphanous enriched at the tips. The Rac1-like phenotypes, and filopodia formation, could be blocked by co-expression of dominant negative Rac1.

Much of this work makes predictions about how potential hosts should invest in overall immunity. However, this 'overall' perspective under-emphasizes other critical aspects, such as the specificity, inducibility and timing of an immune response. Here, we investigate these aspects by examining gene regulation across several immune system components in both male and female Drosophila melanogaster prior to and after mating. To elucidate potentially important temporal dynamics, we also assayed several genes over time. We found that males and females emphasized different components of their immune system, however overall investment was similar. Specifically, the sexes emphasized different gene paralogues within major gene families, and males tended to invest more in gram-negative defence. By contrast, the inducibility of the immune response was both transient (lasting approx. 24 hours) and equal between the sexes. Furthermore, mating tended to induce humoral gene upregulation, while cell-mediated genes were unaffected. Within the humoral system, gram-negative bacterial defence genes exhibited a greater inducibility than those associated with fungal or gram-positive bacterial defence.

We developed a zygomycosis model by injecting Drosophila melanogaster flies with a standardized amount of fungal spores from clinical Zygomycetes isolates to study virulence and host defense mechanisms. We found that, as opposed to most other fungi, which are nonpathogenic in D. melanogaster (e.g., Aspergillus fumigatus), Zygomycetes rapidly infect and kill wild-type flies. Toll-deficient flies exhibited increased susceptibility to Zygomycetes, whereas constitutive overexpression of the antifungal peptide Drosomycin in transgenic flies partially restored resistance to zygomycosis. D. melanogaster Schneider 2 phagocytic cells displayed decreased phagocytosis and caused less hyphal damage to Zygomycetes compared with that to A. fumigatus. Furthermore, phagocytosis-defective eater mutant flies displayed increased susceptibility to Zygomycetes infection. Classic enhancers of Zygomycetes virulence in humans, such as corticosteroids, increased iron supply, and iron availability through treatment with deferoxamine dramatically increased Zygomycetes pathogenicity in our model. In contrast, iron starvation induced by treatment with the iron chelator deferasirox significantly protected flies infected with Zygomycetes. Whole-genome expression profiling in wild-type flies after infection with Zygomycetes vs. A. fumigatus identified genes selectively down-regulated by Zygomycetes, which act in pathogen recognition, immune defense, stress response, detoxification, steroid metabolism, or tissue repair or have unknown functions.

Surprisingly, diet manipulation did not reproducibly alter pathogen resistance, despite its significant effect on the expression of many immunity-related genes. Considering that chronic or frequent activation of the immune system results in reduced longevity, we postulate that the longevity extending potential of the above mutations may be partially obscured by parallel activation of the immune system.

Using a bacterial infection model in Drosophila, we uncovered a p38 MAP kinase-mediated mechanism of tolerance to intracellular bacterial infection as measured by the extent to which the host's survival rate increased or was maintained despite increasing bacterial burden. This increased survival was conferred primarily by a tolerance strategy whereby p38-dependent phagocytic encapsulation of bacteria resulted in enlarged phagocytes that trap bacteria.

In cells, RNAi targeting of rudra caused a marked up-regulation of antimicrobial peptide gene expression. rudra mutant flies also hyper-activated antimicrobial peptide genes and were more resistant to infection with the insect pathogen Erwinia carotovora carotovora. Molecularly, Rudra was found to bind and interfere with both PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, disrupting their signaling complex. These results show that Rudra is a critical component in a negative feedback loop, whereby immune-induced gene expression rapidly produces a potent inhibitor that binds and inhibits pattern recognition receptors.",2008,PLoS pathogens,6.7,Aggarwal K,Silverman N,"Divison of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts, United States of America.",USA

We have used mutations in the Drosophila Ubc9 (dUbc9) gene to understand Ubc9 functions in vivo. Loss-of-function mutations in dUbc9 cause strong mitotic defects in larval hematopoietic tissues, an increase in the number of hematopoietic precursors in the lymph gland and of mature blood cells in circulation, and an increase in the proportion of cyclin-B-positive cells. Some blood cells are polyploid and multinucleate, exhibiting signs of genomic instability. We also observe an overabundance of highly differentiated blood cells (lamellocytes), normally not found in healthy larvae. Lamellocytes in mutants are either free in circulation or recruited to form tumorous masses. Hematopoietic defects of dUbc9 mutants are strongly suppressed in the absence of the Rel/NF-kappaB-family transcription factors Dorsal and Dif or in the presence of a non-signaling allele of Cactus, the IkappaB protein in Drosophila. In the larval fat body, dUbc9 negatively regulates the expression of the antifungal peptide gene drosomycin, which is constitutively expressed in dUbc9 mutants in the absence of immune challenge. dUbc9-mediated drosomycin expression requires Dorsal and Dif.

The systematic mutagenesis of a minimal Mtk 5' enhancer identified a sequence motif essential for both a response to LPS preparations in S2 cells and activation in the larval fat body in response to bacterial infection. Using affinity chromatography coupled to multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT), we identified DEAF-1 as a candidate regulator. DEAF-1 activates the expression of Mtk and Drs promoter-luciferase fusion genes in S2 cells. SELEX assays and footprinting data indicate that DEAF-1 binds to and activates Mtk and Drs regulatory DNAs via a TTCGGBT motif. The insertion of this motif into the Diptericin (Dpt) regulatory region confers DEAF-1 responsiveness to this normally DEAF-1-independent enhancer.

In aging mammals, immune function declines and chronic inflammation develops. The biological significance of this phenomenon and its relationship with aging is a priority for aging research. Drosophila is an invaluable tool in understanding the effects of aging on the immune response. Similar to the state of chronic inflammation in mammals, Drosophila exhibits a drastic up-regulation of immunity-related genes with age. However, it remains unclear whether immune function declines with age as seen in mammals. We evaluated the impact of aging on Drosophila immune function by examining across age the ability to eliminate and survive different doses of bacterial invaders.

Immune response of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to Gram-negative bacteria is primarily mediated via the Imd (immune deficiency) pathway, which closely resembles the mammalian TNFR signaling pathway. Instead of cytokines, the main outcome of Imd signaling is the production of antimicrobial peptides. The pathway activity is delicately regulated. Although many of the Imd pathway components are known, the mechanisms of negative regulation are more elusive. In this study we report that a previously uncharacterized gene, pirk, is highly induced upon Gram-negative bacterial infection in Drosophila in vitro and in vivo. pirk encodes a cytoplasmic protein that coimmunoprecipitates with Imd and the cytoplasmic tail of peptidoglycan recognition protein LC (PGRP-LC). RNA interference-mediated down-regulation of Pirk caused Imd pathway hyperactivation upon infection with Gram-negative bacteria, while overexpression of pirk reduced the Imd pathway response both in vitro and in vivo.

Gut-microbe contact rapidly activates PLCbeta through Galphaq, which in turn mobilizes intracellular Ca(2+) through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation for DUOX-dependent ROS production. PLCbeta mutant flies had a short life span due to the uncontrolled propagation of an essential nutritional microbe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in the gut. Gut-specific reintroduction of the PLCbeta restored efficient DUOX-dependent microbe-eliminating capacity and normal host survival.

Tracheal melanization can be activated by the presence of microorganisms but is normally blocked by Spn77Ba, a protease inhibitor in the serpin family. Spn77Ba inhibits a protease cascade involving the MP1 and MP2 proteases that activates phenol oxidase, a key enzyme in melanin biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, we found that tracheal melanization resulting from Spn77Ba disruption induces systemic expression of the antifungal peptide Drosomycin via the Toll pathway.

Additionally, reduction of DNase II enzymatic activity in Drosophila melanogaster has been shown to lead to increased accumulation of DNA in the ovaries. Due to the importance of DNA clearance during infection, we hypothesized that a severe reduction of DNase II activity would result in diminished immune function and viability. To test this hypothesis, we knocked down DNase II activity in flies using RNAi. As expected, expression of a dnase II-RNAi construct in flies resulted in a dramatic reduction of DNase II activity and a significant decrease in total hemocyte numbers. Furthermore, infection of dnase II-RNAi flies with Gram negative or positive bacteria resulted in a severe reduction in fly viability.

We also report that in mutants such as Toll or cactus, which exhibit melanotic tumor phenotypes, dl is constitutively nuclear. Together, these results point to a potential link between the Toll signaling pathway and melanotic tumor induction. Although dl has been shown previously to bind to kappa B-related motifs within the promoter of the antibacterial peptide coding gene diptericin, we find that injury-induced expression of diptericin can occur in the absence of dl.

Because of the differences in peptidoglycan peptide linkages in these bacteria, our data suggest that PGRP-SC1a is necessary for recognition of the Lys-type peptidoglycan typical of most Gram(+) bacteria. PGRP-SC1a mutants also fail to activate the Toll/NF-kappaB signaling pathway and are compromised for survival after S. aureus infection. This mutant phenotype is the first found for an N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase PGRP that cleaves peptidoglycan at the lactylamide bond between the glycan backbone and the crosslinking stem peptides. By generating transgenic rescue flies that express either wild-type or a noncatalytic cysteine-serine mutant PGRP-SC1a, we find that PGRP-SC1a amidase activity is not necessary for Toll signaling, but is essential for uptake of S. aureus into the host phagocytes and for survival after S. aureus infection. Furthermore, we find that the PGRP-SC1a amidase activity can be substituted by exogenous addition of free peptidoglycan, suggesting that the presence of peptidoglycan cleavage products is more important than the generation of cleaved peptidoglycan on the bacterial surface for PGRP-SC1a mediated phagocytosis.",2006,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,11.1,Garver LS,Wu LP,"Center for Biosystems Research, University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute, 5115 Plant Sciences Building, College Park, MD 20742, USA.",USA

Here we show that before processing the pro-domain of Spätzle is required for correct biosynthesis and secretion. We mapped two loss-of-function mutations of Spätzle to a discrete site in the pro-domain and showed that the phenotype arises because of a defect in biosynthesis rather than signaling. We also report that the pro-domain and C-106 remain associated after cleavage and that this processed complex signals with the same characteristics as the C-terminal fragment. These results suggest that before activation the determinants on C-106 that bind specifically to Toll are sequestered by the pro-domain and that proteolytic processing causes conformational rearrangements that expose these determinants and enables binding to Toll.

Analysis of DTRAF1 binding to different members of the human TNF receptor family showed that this protein can interact through its TRAF domain with the p75 neurotrophin receptor and weakly with the lymphotoxin-beta receptor. DTRAF1 can also self-associate and binds to human TRAF1, TRAF2, and TRAF4. Interestingly, DTRAF1 interacts with human cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 but not with Drosophila DIAP-1 and -2.

Flies orally infected with P. entomophila rapidly succumb despite the induction of both local and systemic immune responses, indicating that this bacterium has developed specific strategies to escape the fly immune response. Using a combined genetic approach on both host and pathogen, we showed that P. entomophila virulence is multi-factorial with a clear differentiation between factors that trigger the immune response and those that promote pathogenicity. We demonstrate that AprA, an abundant secreted metalloprotease produced by P. entomophila, is an important virulence factor. Inactivation of aprA attenuated both the capacity to persist in the host and pathogenicity. Interestingly, aprA mutants were able to survive to wild-type levels in immune-deficient Relish flies, indicating that the protease plays an important role in protection against the Drosophila immune response. Our study also reveals that the major contribution to the fly defense against P. entomophila is provided by the local, rather than the systemic immune response.

Understanding of this pathogenesis is limited, but it appears that host factors, induced by microbes, can have a direct cost to the host organism. Mutations in wntD cause susceptibility to Listeria monocytogenes infection, apparently through the derepression of Toll-Dorsal target genes, some of which are deleterious to survival. Here, we use gene expression profiling to identify genes that may mediate the observed susceptibility of wntD mutants to lethal infection. These genes include the TNF family member eiger and the novel immunity gene edin (elevated during infection; synonym CG32185), both of which are more strongly induced by infection of wntD mutants compared to controls. edin is also expressed more highly during infection of wild-type flies with wild-type Salmonella typhimurium than with a less pathogenic mutant strain, and its expression is regulated in part by the Imd pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of edin can induce age-dependent lethality, while loss of function in edin renders flies more susceptible to Listeria infection.

Phagocytes also ensure optimal viability during post-embryonic development through immune functions. The use of phagocyte-depleted flies reveals the contribution of phagocytes in the resistance of Drosophila adults upon systemic infections with specific bacteria. Phagocytes were not involved in the expression of antimicrobial peptides by the fat body indicating a clear separation between cellular and humoral immune responses at this stage.

A mass spectrometric analysis of the cleavage products demonstrates that the enzyme hydrolyzes the lactylamide bond between the glycan strand and the cross-linking peptides. This result assigns the protein as an N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase (EC ), and the corresponding gene is thus the first of this class to be described from a eukaryotic organism. Mutant forms of PGRP-SC1B lacking a potential zinc ligand are enzymatically inactive but retain their peptidoglycan affinity. The immunostimulatory properties of PGRP-SC1B-degraded peptidoglycan are much reduced. This is in striking contrast to lysozyme-digested peptidoglycan, which retains most of its elicitor activity. This points toward a scavenger function for PGRP-SC1B.

Microbial recognition upstream of Toll involves, at least in part, peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). The sensing of Gram-positive bacteria is mediated by the pattern recognition receptors PGRP-SA and Gram-negative binding protein 1 (GNBP1) that cooperate to detect the presence of lysine-type peptidoglycan in the host. Recently it has been shown that a loss-of-function mutation in peptidoglycan recognition protein SD (PGRP-SD) severely exacerbates the PGRP-SA and GNBP1 mutant phenotypes. Here we have solved the crystal structure of PGRP-SD at 1.5A resolution. Comparison with available structures of PGRPs in complex with their peptidoglycan (PGN) ligand strongly suggests a diaminopimelic acid (DAP) specificity for PGRP-SD.

To investigate other possible routes of bacterial infection, we deposited Erwinia carotovora (Ecc15) on various sites of the cuticle and monitored the immune response via expression of the AMP gene Diptericin. A strong response was observed to deposition on the genital plate of males (up to 20% of a septic injury response), but not females. We show that the principal response to genital infection is systemic, but that some AMPs, particularly Defensin, are induced locally in the genital tract. At late time points we detected bacteria in the haemolymph of immune deficient Relish(E20) flies, indicating that the genital plate can be a route of entry for pathogens, and that the immune response protects flies against the progression of genital infection. The protective role of the immune response is further illustrated by our observation that Relish(E20) flies exhibit significant lethality in response to genital Ecc15 infections. We next show that a systemic immune response can be induced by deposition of the bacterial elicitor peptidoglycan (PGN), or its terminal monomer tracheal cytotoxin (TCT), on the genital plate. This immune response is downregulated by PGRP-LB and Pirk, known regulators of the Imd pathway, and can be suppressed by the overexpression of PGRP-LB in the haemolymph compartment. Finally, we provide strong evidence that TCT can activate a systemic response by crossing epithelia, by showing that radiolabelled TCT deposited on the genital plate can subsequently be detected in the haemolymph. Genital infection is thus an intriguing new model for studying the systemic immune response to local epithelial infections and a potential route of entry for naturally occurring pathogens of Drosophila.",2009,PLoS pathogens,6.7,Gendrin M,Lemaitre B,"Global Health Institute, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland.",Switzerland

Here we show that in the absence of both genes, the immune-inducibility of drosomycin is lost but can be rescued by overexpression of either dorsal or dif under the control of a heat-shock promoter. This result suggests a functional redundancy between both Rel proteins in the control of drosomycin gene expression in the larvae of Drosophila. Interestingly, the gene encoding the antibacterial peptide Diptericin remains fully inducible in the absence of the dorsal and dif genes.

Unexpectedly, these plasmatocyte-depleted animals have a normal larval and pupal development and do not exhibit any obvious defect after birth. Remarkably, plasmatocyte-depleted adults show a strong susceptibility to infections by various microorganisms, although activation of systemic AMP gene transcription via the Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways is wild-type. Our data show that this susceptibility, which correlates with overproliferation of bacteria, is likely due to the absence of phagocytosis.

Induction of these antimicrobial peptides in Drosophila has been well established to involve NF-kappaB elements. We present evidence here for a molecular mechanism of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced signaling involving Drosophila NF-kappaB, RELISH, in Drosophila S2 cells. We demonstrate that LPS induces a rapid processing event within the RELISH protein releasing the C-terminal ankyrin-repeats from the N-terminal Rel homology domain (RHD). Examination of the cellular localization of RELISH reveals that the timing of this processing coincides with the nuclear translocation of the RHD and the retention of the ankyrin-repeats within the cytoplasm. Both the processing and the nuclear translocation immediately precede the expression of antibacterial peptide genes cecropin A1, attacin, and diptericin. Over-expression of the RHD but not full-length RELISH results in an increase in the promoter activity of the cecropin A1 gene in the absence of LPS. Furthermore, the LPS-induced expression of these antibacterial peptides is greatly reduced when RELISH expression is depleted via RNA-mediated interference. In addition, loss of cactus expression via RNAi revealed that RELISH activation and nuclear translocation is not dependent on the presence of cactus. Taken together, these results suggest that this signaling mechanism involving the processing of RELISH followed by nuclear translocation of the RHD is central to the induction of at least part of the antimicrobial response in Drosophila, and is largely independent of cactus regulation.",2001,Journal of cellular biochemistry,4.0,Cornwell WD,Kirkpatrick RB,"Department of Gene Expression Sciences, GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA.",USA

Reduction of integral variability or quantification problems related to conventional two-dimensional electrophoresis and improvement of image analysis were achieved by the use of two fluorescent dyes to label the two different protein samples.

This response is manifested by an increased number of circulating cells, the hemocytes, and by the appearance of a specialized class of hemocyte, the lamellocytes, which participate in the encapsulation and killing of the parasite. To study the molecular mechanisms of this response, we have overexpressed different genes in the hemocytes, by using the GAL4-upstream activating sequence system and a hemocyte-specific Hemese-GAL4 driver. Multiple transgenes were tested, representing several important signaling pathways. We found that the proliferation response and the activation of lamellocyte formation are independent phenomena. A drastic increase in the number of circulating hemocytes is caused by receptor tyrosine kinases, such as Egfr, Pvr, and Alk, as well as by the downstream signaling components Ras85D and pointed, supporting the notion that the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway regulates hemocyte numbers. In the case of Pvr and Alk, this phenotype also is accompanied by lamellocyte formation. By contrast, constitutively active hopscotch and hemipterous give massive activation of lamellocyte formation with little or no increase in total hemocyte numbers. This finding indicates that both the Jak/Stat and the Jun kinase pathways affect lamellocyte formation. Still other signals, mediated by aop(ACT), Toll(10b), and Rac1 expression, cause a simultaneous increase in lamellocyte and total cell numbers, and the same effect is seen when WNT signaling is suppressed.

In Drosophila, PGRPs bind peptidoglycan and function as central sensors and regulators of the innate immune response. PGRP-LC/PGRP-LE constitute the receptor complex in the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway, which is an innate immune cascade triggered upon Gram-negative bacterial infection. Here, we present the functional analysis of the nonamidase, membrane-associated PGRP-LF. We show that PGRP-LF acts as a specific negative regulator of the IMD pathway. Reduction of PGRP-LF levels, in the absence of infection, is sufficient to trigger IMD pathway activation. Furthermore, normal development is impaired in the absence of functional PGRP-LF, a phenotype mediated by the JNK pathway. Thus, PGRP-LF prevents constitutive activation of both the JNK and the IMD pathways.

Drosomycin is the most expressed antimicrobial peptide in Drosophila melanogaster immune response. A truncated scorpion beta-toxin is capable of binding and inducing conformational alteration of voltage-gated sodium channels.

Thus, the short CSalphabeta scaffold of drosomycin and the truncated scorpion toxin can maintain more than one bioactivity, and, in light of this new observation, we suggest that the biological role of peptides bearing this scaffold should be carefully examined.

IMD signaling also activates the JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade, which is responsible for immune induction of non-antimicrobial peptide immune gene transcription though the transcription factor AP-1. Transcription of the Dopa decarboxylase (Ddc) gene is induced in response to gram-negative and gram-positive septic injury, but not aseptic wounding. Transcription is induced throughout the epidermis and not specifically at the site of infection. Ddc transcripts are detectible within 2 h and remain high for several hours following infection with either gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria. Using Ddc-green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene constructs, we show that a conserved consensus AP-1 binding site upstream of the Ddc transcription start site is required for induction. However, neither the Toll, IMD, nor JNK pathway is involved. Rather, Ddc transcription depends on a previously uncharacterized member of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase family, p38c.

When fed with ROS-resistant microbes, NF-kappaB pathway mutant flies, but not wild-type flies, become highly susceptible to gut infection.

The Nec protein is a member of the serpin (SERine Protease INhibitor) superfamily and is thought to regulate the cascade by inhibiting the serine protease Persephone. Nec was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein folded to the active native conformation required for protease inhibitory activity. Biochemical analysis showed that Nec had a broad inhibitory specificity and inhibited elastase, thrombin, and chymotrypsin-like proteases. It did not inhibit trypsin or kallikrein.

The transcription factors NF-kappaB, AP-1, and STAT play major roles in the synthesis of immune effector molecules during innate immune responses. However, the fact that these immune responses can have cytotoxic effects requires their tight regulation to achieve restricted and transient activation, and mis-regulation of the damping process has pathological consequences. Here we show that AP-1 and STAT are themselves the major inhibitors responsible for damping NF-kappaB-mediated transcriptional activation during the innate immune response in Drosophila. As the levels of dAP-1 and Stat92E increase due to continuous immune signaling, they play a repressive role by forming a repressosome complex with the Drosophila HMG protein, Dsp1. The dAP-1-, Stat92E-, and Dsp1-containing complexes replace Relish at the promoters of diverse immune effector genes by binding to evolutionarily conserved cis-elements, and they recruit histone deacetylase to inhibit transcription. Reduction by mutation of dAP-1, Stat92E, or Dsp1 results in hyperactivation of Relish target genes and reduces the viability of bacterially infected flies despite more efficient pathogen clearance. These defects are rescued by reducing the Relish copy number, thus confirming that mis-regulation of Relish, not inadequate activation of dAP-1, Stat92E, or Dsp1 target genes, is responsible for the reduced survival of the mutants. We conclude that an inhibitory effect of AP-1 and STAT on NF-kappaB is required for properly balanced immune responses and appears to be evolutionarily conserved.",2007,PLoS biology,9.8,Kim LK,Kim YJ,"Department of Biochemistry, National Creative Research Initiative Center for Genome Regulation, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.",Korea

However, the molecular identities of such receptors are still obscure. Here, we present data showing that Drosophila possesses at least three cDNAs encoding members of the Gram-negative bacteria-binding protein (DGNBP) family, one of which, DGNBP-1, has been characterized. Western blot, flow cytometric, and confocal laser microscopic analyses demonstrate that DGNBP-1 exists in both a soluble and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane form in culture medium supernatant and on Drosophila immunocompetent cells, respectively. DGNBP-1 has a high affinity to microbial immune elicitors such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and beta-1,3-glucan whereas no binding affinity is detected with peptidoglycan, beta-1,4-glucan, or chitin. Importantly, the overexpression of DGNBP-1 in Drosophila immunocompetent cells enhances LPS- and beta-1,3-glucan-induced innate immune gene (NF-kappaB-dependent antimicrobial peptide gene) expression, which can be specifically blocked by pretreatment with anti-DGNBP-1 antibody. These results suggest that DGNBP-1 functions as a pattern recognition receptor for LPS from Gram-negative bacteria and beta-1, 3-glucan from fungi and plays an important role in non-self recognition and the subsequent immune signal transmission for the induction of antimicrobial peptide genes in the Drosophila innate immune system.",2000,The Journal of biological chemistry,4.8,Kim YS,Lee WJ,"Laboratory of Immunology, BK21 Center for Medical Science and Medical Research Center, Yonsei University College of Medicine, 134 Shinchon-dong, CPO Box 8044, Seoul, South Korea.",South Korea

Toll is activated by high affinity binding of the cytokine Spätzle, a dimeric ligand of the cystine knot family. In vertebrates, a related family of Toll-like receptors play a critical role in innate immune responses. Despite the importance of this family of receptors, little is known about the biochemical events that lead to receptor activation and signaling. Here, we show that Spätzle binds to the N-terminal region of Toll and, using biophysical methods, that the binding is complex. The two binding events that cause formation of the cross-linked complex are non-equivalent: the first Toll ectodomain binds Spätzle with an affinity 3-fold higher than the second molecule suggesting that pathway activation involves negative cooperativity. We further show that the Toll ectodomains are able to form low affinity dimers in solution and that juxtamembrane sequences of Toll are critical for the activation or derepression of the pathway.

1611,Wei Y;Xiao Q;Zhang T;Mou Z;You J;Ma WJ,Differential regulation of mRNA stability controls the transient expression of genes encoding Drosophila antimicrobial peptide with distinct immune response characteristics.,19726583,37,19,The tight regulation of transiently expressed antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with a distinct antimicrobial spectrum and different expression kinetics contributes greatly to the properly regulated immune response for resistance to pathogens and for the maintenance of mutualistic microbiota in Drosophila. The important role of differential regulation of AMP expression at the posttranscriptional level needs to be elucidated. It was observed that the highly expressed Cecropin A1 (CecA1) mRNA encoding a broad antimicrobial spectrum AMP against both bacteria and fungi decayed more quickly than did the moderately expressed Diptericin mRNA encoding AMP against Gram negative bacteria. The mRNA stability of AMPs is differentially regulated and is attributed to the specific interaction between cis-acting ARE in 3'-UTR of AMP mRNA and the RNA destabilizing protein transactor Tis11 as shown in co-immunoprecipitation of the Tis11 RNP complex with CecA1 mRNA but not other AMP mRNA. The p38MAPK was further demonstrated to play a crucial role in stabilizing ARE-bearing mRNAs by inhibiting Tis11-mediated degradation in LPS induced AMP expression. This evidence suggests an evolutionarily conserved and functionally important molecular basis for and effective approach to exact control of AMP gene expression.

During phagocytosis, particles are internalized into 'phagosomes', organelles from which immune processes such as microbial destruction and antigen presentation are initiated. Certain pathogens have evolved mechanisms to evade the immune system and persist undetected within phagocytes, and it is therefore evident that a detailed knowledge of this process is essential to an understanding of many aspects of innate and adaptive immunity. However, despite the crucial role of phagosomes in immunity, their components and organization are not fully defined. Here we present a systems biology analysis of phagosomes isolated from cells derived from the genetically tractable model organism Drosophila melanogaster and address the complex dynamic interactions between proteins within this organelle and their involvement in particle engulfment. Proteomic analysis identified 617 proteins potentially associated with Drosophila phagosomes; these were organized by protein-protein interactions to generate the 'phagosome interactome', a detailed protein-protein interaction network of this subcellular compartment. These networks predicted both the architecture of the phagosome and putative biomodules. The contribution of each protein and complex to bacterial internalization was tested by RNA-mediated interference and identified known components of the phagocytic machinery. In addition, the prediction and validation of regulators of phagocytosis such as the 'exocyst', a macromolecular complex required for exocytosis but not previously implicated in phagocytosis, validates this strategy. In generating this 'systems-based model', we show the power of applying this approach to the study of complex cellular processes and organelles and expect that this detailed model of the phagosome will provide a new framework for studying host-pathogen interactions and innate immunity.",2007,Nature,64.8,Stuart LM,Ezekowitz RA,"Laboratory of Developmental Immunology, Massachusetts General Hospital/ Harvard Medical School, 55 Fruit Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02114, USA. lstuart@partners.org",USA

However, despite the central role that the NF-kappaB pathway plays in eliciting antimicrobial responses, NF-kappaB pathway mutant flies are totally resistant to such infections.

To search for cell wall components that modulate innate immune responses in host organisms, we examined Staphylococcus aureus mutants, which were deficient in components of the cell wall, for pathogenicity in Drosophila. A mutation of dltA, which is responsible for the D-alanylation of teichoic acids, brought about an increase in the survival rate of adult flies that had received a septic infection with the bacteria. The growth of dltA-deficient S. aureus in adult flies was less efficient than that of the parental strain. The level of mRNA of Toll pathway-dependent antimicrobial peptides was higher in flies infected with the dltA mutant than that observed after the infection with the parental strain. The defective phenotype associated with the mutation of dltA, reduced pathogenicity and growth, was not evident in flies lacking the Toll pathway. Finally, a fraction of peptidoglycan prepared from the dltA mutant induced the expression of mRNA of a Toll-dependent antimicrobial peptide in flies and was bound by peptidoglycan recognition protein-SA in vitro more effectively than that obtained from the parental strain, and this difference was lost after the removal of wall teichoic acid from peptidoglycan.

The Drosophila genome encodes 29 serpins, of which only two, Serpin-27A (Spn27A) and Necrotic, have been analyzed in detail. Using a genetic approach, we demonstrate that the so far uncharacterized Serpin-28D (Spn28D, CG7219) regulates the proPO cascade in both hemolymph and tracheal compartments. spn28D is the serpin gene most strongly induced upon injury. Inactivation of spn28D causes pupal lethality and a deregulated developmental PO activation leading to extensive melanization of tissues in contact with air and pigmentation defects of the adult cuticle. Our data also show that Spn28D regulates hemolymph PO activity in both larvae and adults at a different level than Spn27A.

In this work, we tested the capacity of virgin and mated female Drosophila melanogaster to defend against infection by four bacterial pathogens. We found that female D. melanogaster suffer post-mating immunosuppression in a pathogen-dependent manner. The effect of mating was seen after infection with two bacterial pathogens (Providencia rettgeri and Providencia alcalifaciens), though not after infection with two other bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). We then asked whether the evolution of post-mating immunosuppression is primarily a 'female' or 'male' trait by assaying for genetic variation among females for the degree of post-mating immune suppression they experience and among males for the level of post-mating immunosuppression they elicit in their mates. We also assayed for an interaction between male and female genotypes to test the specific hypothesis that the evolution of a trade-off between mating and immune defence in females might be being driven by sexual conflict. We found that females, but not males, harbour significant genetic variation for post-mating immunosuppression, and we did not detect an interaction between female and male genotypes.

We partitioned these fundamentally different effects by instead examining the expression profiles of virgin, single mated and double mated females. We found substantial effects relating to reproduction and further effects that are only attributable to mating itself. Immune response genes dominate this male-induced effect indicating that the cost of mating may be due partly to this system's activation. We propose that both sexually antagonistic and natural selection have been important in the evolution of the innate immunity genes, thereby contributing to the sexual dimorphism and rapid evolution at these loci.",2009,Journal of evolutionary biology,2.1,Innocenti P,Morrow EH,"Department of Animal Ecology, Evolutionary Biology Center, Uppsala University, Norbyvägen 18D, Uppsala, Sweden. paolo.innocenti@ebc.uu.se",Sweden

We carried out an RNA interference (RNAi)-based genome-wide in vitro reporter assay screen in Drosophila for components of NF-kappaB pathways. We analyzed 16,025 dsRNA-treatments and identified 10 novel NF-kappaB regulators. Of these, nine dsRNA-treatments affect primarily the Toll pathway. G protein-coupled receptor kinase (Gprk)2, CG15737/Toll pathway activation mediating protein, and u-shaped were required for normal Drosomycin response in vivo. Interaction studies revealed that Gprk2 interacts with the Drosophila IkappaB homolog Cactus, but is not required in Cactus degradation, indicating a novel mechanism for NF-kappaB regulation. Morpholino silencing of the zebrafish ortholog of Gprk2 in fish embryos caused impaired cytokine expression after Escherichia coli infection, indicating a conserved role in NF-kappaB signaling. Moreover, small interfering RNA silencing of the human ortholog GRK5 in HeLa cells impaired NF-kappaB reporter activity. Gprk2 RNAi flies are susceptible to infection with Enterococcus faecalis and Gprk2 RNAi rescues Toll(10b)-induced blood cell activation in Drosophila larvae in vivo.

Despite this central role, the in vivo contributions of phagocytosis to systemic immune activation are not well understood. Drosophila has proven a fruitful model for the investigation of evolutionarily conserved innate immune mechanisms, including NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional induction, RNAi in antiviral responses, and phagocytosis. The phagocytes of Drosophila encounter bacterial invaders early in infection and contribute to survival of infection. Phagocytosis in flies and mammals is highly homologous: Both rely on scavenger receptors, opsonins, and actin rearrangements for engulfment; have phagosomal cysteine proteases active at low pH; and can be subverted by similar intracellular pathogens. Although the role of Drosophila phagocytes in the activation of other immune tissues has not been clear, we show that induction of the antibacterial-peptide gene Defensin in the fat body during infection requires blood-cell contributions. We identify a gene, psidin, that encodes a lysosomal protein required in the blood cells for both degradation of engulfed bacteria and activation of fat-body Defensin.

NOS was up-regulated after infection. Antimicrobial peptide reporters revealed that NO triggered an immune response in uninfected larvae. NO induction of Diptericin reporters in the fat body required immune deficiency (imd) and domino. These findings show that NOS activity is required for a robust innate immune response to gram-negative bacteria, NOS is induced by infection, and NO is sufficient to trigger response in the absence of infection.

Here we identify genes in both the host and microbe that are involved in the pathogenesis of infection and disease in Drosophila melanogaster challenged with Salmonella enterica serovartyphimurium (S. typhimurium). We demonstrate that wild-typeS. typhimurium causes a lethal systemic infection when injected into the hemocoel of D. melanogaster. Deletion of the gene encoding the secreted bacterial effect or Salmonella leucine-rich (PslrP)changes an acute and lethal infection to one that is persistent and less deadly. We propose a model in which Salmonella secreted effectors stimulate the fly and thus cause an immune response that is damaging both to the bacteria and, subsequently, to the host. In support of this model, we show that mutations in the fly gene eiger, a TNF homolog, delay the lethality of Salmonella infection. These results suggest that S. typhimurium-infected flies die from a condition that resembles TNF-induced metabolic collapse in vertebrates.

In addition, most retain a characteristic intron-exon structure shared with the prototype Spätzle gene. This provides evidence that the family arose by ancient gene duplication events and indicates that the gene products may represent activating ligands for corresponding Toll receptors. Expression studies show that only Spz4 is expressed strongly in larvae and adults and thus may be involved in an ancillary antifungal response mediated by Toll-5.

In Drosophila melanogaster females, sex peptide (SP) is the major seminal agent eliciting oviposition and reduction of receptivity. But SP also has many other effects; for example, it stimulates food intake, egg production, ovulation, juvenile hormone production and antimicrobial peptide synthesis. Thus, SP very probably has several receptors. To identify putative targets and signaling cascades, we studied the genome-wide regulation of genes by microarray analysis of RNA isolated from females after mating with wild-type males or males lacking SP, respectively. In addition, we studied the effects of SP on the proteome of females. Sex peptide regulates gene activity differentially in the head and in the abdomen. Genes coding for unspecific antimicrobial peptides are specifically transcribed in the abdomen, e.g. the antimicrobial peptide drosocin in epithelial tissues of the female genital tract (oviduct and calyx). Hence, SP elicits a systemic [Peng J, Zipperlen P & Kubli E (2005) Curr Biol15, 1690-1694] and an epithelial immune response. Ectopic expression of SP in the fat body of transgenic virgin females (with subsequent secretion into the hemolymph) does not elicit drosocin synthesis in the genital tract. Thus, the receptors for the stimulation of the systemic and the epithelial responses by SP are compartmentalized. The hydroxyproline (P*) motif of SP, P*TKFP*IP*SP*NP*, is identified as a novel elicitor of the innate immune response.

The Toll pathway mediates most defenses against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, whereas the Imd pathway is required to resist Gram-negative bacterial infection.

Three GNBPs and two related proteins are encoded in the Drosophila genome, but their function is not known. Using inducible expression of GNBP1 double-stranded RNA, we now demonstrate that GNBP1 is required for Toll activation in response to Gram-positive bacterial infection; GNBP1 double-stranded RNA expression renders flies susceptible to Gram-positive bacterial infection and reduces the induction of the antifungal peptide encoding gene Drosomycin after infection by Gram-positive bacteria but not after fungal infection. This phenotype induced by GNBP1 inactivation is identical to a loss-of-function mutation in PGRP-SA, and our genetic studies suggest that GNBP1 acts upstream of the Toll ligand Spätzle.

Although this rhythm is abolished in clock mutant flies, those with an inactive period gene are highly susceptible to infection, whereas mutants with impairment in other core clock genes exhibit enhanced survival. After an initial phase of strong suppression, the kinetics of bacterial growth correlate highly with time of day and clock mutant effects on survival.

In addition, we find that the activated DmIKK complex, as well as recombinant DmIKKbeta, can phosphorylate Relish in vitro. Thus, we propose that the Drosophila IkappaB kinase complex functions, at least in part, by inducing the proteolytic cleavage of Relish. The N terminus of Relish then translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of antibacterial immune response genes. Remarkably, this Drosophila IkappaB kinase complex is not required for the activation of the Rel proteins Dif and Dorsal through the Toll signaling pathway, which is essential for antifungal immunity and dorsoventral patterning during early development.

Similar capsules of lamellocytes, called melanotic capsules, are also formed around ""self"" tissues in larvae carrying gain-of-function mutations in Toll and hopscotch. Constitutive differentiation of lamellocytes in larvae carrying these mutations is accompanied by high concentrations of plasmatocytes, the major hemocyte class in uninfected control larvae. The relative contributions of hemocyte concentration vs. lamellocyte differentiation to wasp egg encapsulation are not known. To address this question, we used Leptopilina boulardi to infect more than a dozen strains of host larvae harboring a wide range of hemocyte densities. We report a significant correlation between hemocyte concentration and encapsulation capacity among wild-type larvae and larvae heterozygous for mutations in the Hopscotch-Stat92E and Toll-Dorsal pathways. Larvae carrying loss-of-function mutations in Hopscotch, Stat92E, or dorsal group genes exhibit significant reduction in encapsulation capacity. Larvae carrying loss-of-function mutations in dorsal group genes (including Toll and tube) have reduced hemocyte concentrations, whereas larvae deficient in Hopscotch-Stat92E signaling do not. Surprisingly, unlike hopscotch mutants, Toll and tube mutants are not compromised in their ability to generate lamellocytes. Our results suggest that circulating hemocyte concentration and lamellocyte differentiation constitute two distinct physiological requirements of wasp egg encapsulation and Toll and Hopscotch proteins serve distinct roles in this process.",2004,Genetics,3.3,Sorrentino RP,Govind S,"Department of Biology, City College and Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, New York, New York 10031, USA.",USA

In Drosophila the prototypic Toll regulates both embryonic development and adult immune response. We demonstrate here that the host protein Spätzle can function as a ligand for Toll because Spätzle forms a complex with Toll in transgenic fly extracts and stimulates the expression of a Toll-dependent immunity gene, drosomycin, in adult flies. We also show that constitutively active mutants of Toll form multimers that contain intermolecular disulfide linkages. These disulfide linkages are critical for the activity of one of these mutant receptors, indicating that multimerization is essential for the constitutive activity. Furthermore, systematic mutational analysis revealed that a conserved cysteine-containing motif, different from the cysteines used for the intermolecular disulfide linkages, serves as a self-inhibitory module of Toll. Deleting or mutating this cysteine-containing motif leads to constitutive activity. This motif is located just outside the transmembrane domain and may provide a structural hindrance for multimerization and activation of Toll.

Six genes, Drs-lC, Drs-lD, Drs-lE, Drs-lF, Drs-lG and Drs-lI, show homology to the Drs form in a multigene family on the 3rd chromosome of D. melanogaster. It is the first experimental demonstration that the six members in the Drs family act as functional genes. To further delineate the functional divergence of these six members, their cDNA sequences were cloned respectively into the pET-3C vector and expressed in the E. coli. The antifungal activity of the expression products was assayed using the Cerletti's method. The results showed a difference among the six isoforms in antifungal activity against the tested fungal strains: in which Drs was most effective and showed antifungal activity to all seven fungal strains, whereas isoform Drs-lC was effective to six strains, Drs-lD was effective to five strains, Drs-lG was effective to four strains, and Drs-lE and Drs-lF were effective to only three strains. Drs-lI had no activity against any tested fungal strains. By comparing the variable residue sites of these six isoforms to that of Drosomycin in the three-dimensional structure, we suggested that the reduction in the antifungal activity was due to the variable residues that were not in the alpha-helix. In addition, two inserted residues (RV) in Drs-lI may affect the dimensional structure and resulted in a functional change.

How these receptors can distinguish the two types of PGN remains unclear. Here the structure of the PGRP domain of Drosophila PGRP-LE in complex with tracheal cytotoxin (TCT), the monomeric DAP-type PGN, reveals a buried ionic interaction between the unique carboxyl group of DAP and a previously unrecognized arginine residue. This arginine is conserved in the known DAP-type PGN-interacting PGRPs and contributes significantly to the affinity of the protein for the ligand. Unexpectedly, TCT induces infinite head-to-tail dimerization of PGRP-LE, in which the disaccharide moiety, but not the peptide stem, of TCT is positioned at the dimer interface.

One of these genes has a regulatory role whereas the other, evf, confers an infectious phenotype: its transfer to non-infectious Erwinia strains or to several enterobacteria improves survival in the gut and triggers the immune response. Overexpression of Erwinia virulence factor (evf) allowed bacteria to colonize the apical side of the gut epithelium and in some cases to spread to the body cavity.

3448,RIZKI MT;RIZKI RM,Functional significance of the crystal cells in the larva of Drosophila melanogaster.,13654442,5,2,"Cytoplasmic crystalline inclusions are found in some larval haemocytes of Drosophila melanogaster. Blackening can be experimentally induced in these cells, and previously it was suggested that either the substrate or enzyme for the tyrosine-tyrosinase system leading to melanin production in Drosophila larvae is found in these inclusions in the crystal cells. The present report is an attempt to further localize the enzyme and substrate. Larvae have been fed on food containing alpha-C(14)-tyrosine and autoradiographs of the blood cells taken from these larvae subsequently prepared. The C(14) activity in the crystal cells is restricted to the crystal inclusions in the cells and is significantly higher than that found in the other type of haemocytes, the plasmatocytes. When samples of the blood cells are incubated in DOPA solution, the extra-crystalline cytoplasm becomes blackened while the crystals themselves remain colorless. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the substrate is localized in the crystal inclusions whereas enzyme is found in the surrounding cytoplasm. An in vivo structural isolation would serve to separate enzyme and substrate rather than an inhibition by dehydrogenases as postulated by previous authors. In vitro examination with the phase microscope has shown that the crystal cells rupture easily and the crystals dissolve in the haemolymph. Therefore any treatment which tends to disrupt the structural integrity of the cell will allow the enzyme and substrate to come together. Humoral factors preceding metamorphosis might account for the in vivo release of the enzymatic reaction by initially altering the permeability of the cell.",1959,The Journal of biophysical and biochemical cytology,7.8,RIZKI MT,RIZKI RM,,

By using two Rac1 GTPase effector-loop mutants together with epistasis studies, we show that Rac1 requires the Drosophila melanogaster Jun N-terminal kinase Basket (Bsk), as well as stable actin formation to recruit the sessile hemocyte population. We show that actin stabilization is necessary for Rac1-induced hemocyte activation by lowering cofilin (encoded by the twinstar gene tsr) expression in blood cells. Removing Bsk by RNAi suppressed Rac1-induced release of sessile hemocytes. RNAi against Bsk also suppressed Rac1 induction of lamellocytes, a specialized population of hemocytes necessary for the encapsulation of invading pathogens. Furthermore, Rac1 and Bsk are involved in regulating the formation of actin- and focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-rich placodes in hemocytes. Lastly, Rac1 and Bsk are both required for the proper encapsulation of eggs from the parasitoid wasp Leptipolina boulardi. From these data we conclude that Rac1 induces Bsk activity and stable actin formation for cellular immune activation, leading to sessile hemocyte release and an increase in the number of circulating hemocytes.",2006,Journal of cell science,4.0,Williams MJ,Hultmark D,"Umeå Centre for Molecular Pathogenesis (UCMP), Umeå University, S-901 87, Umeå, Sweden. micheal.williams@ucmp.umu.se",Sweden

Here, we use live imaging of transgenic Drosophila larvae with fluorescently labeled blood cells (hemocytes) to investigate the circulatory dynamics of larval blood cells and their response to tissue injury. We find that, under normal conditions, the free cells rapidly circulate, whereas the tissue-bound cells are sessile. After epidermal wounding, tissue-bound cells around the wound site remain sessile and unresponsive, whereas circulating cells are rapidly recruited to the site of damage by adhesive capture. After capture, these cells distribute across the wound, appear phagocytically active, and are subsequently released back into circulation by the healing epidermis.

In both hemocytes ex vivo and the macrophage-like S2 cell line, lack of D-SCAR significantly decreased phagocytosis of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. In contrast, profilin mutant hemocytes exhibited increased phagocytic activity. Analysis of double mutants suggests that D-SCAR and profilin interact during phagocytosis.

An important class of immune effector molecules to fight pathogen infections are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) that are produced in plants and animals. In Drosophila, the induction of AMPs in response to infection is regulated through the activation of the evolutionarily conserved Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways. Here we show that AMP activation can be achieved independently of these immunoregulatory pathways by the transcription factor FOXO, a key regulator of stress resistance, metabolism and ageing. In non-infected animals, AMP genes are activated in response to nuclear FOXO activity when induced by starvation, using insulin signalling mutants, or by applying small molecule inhibitors. AMP induction is lost in foxo null mutants but enhanced when FOXO is overexpressed. Expression of AMP genes in response to FOXO activity can also be triggered in animals unable to respond to immune challenges due to defects in both the Toll and IMD pathways. Molecular experiments at the Drosomycin promoter indicate that FOXO directly binds to its regulatory region, thereby inducing its transcription. In vivo studies in Drosophila, but also studies in human lung, gut, kidney and skin cells indicate that a FOXO-dependent regulation of AMPs is evolutionarily conserved. Our results indicate a new mechanism of cross-regulation of metabolism and innate immunity by which AMP genes can be activated under normal physiological conditions in response to the oscillating energy status of cells and tissues. This regulation seems to be independent of the pathogen-responsive innate immunity pathways whose activation is often associated with tissue damage and repair. The sparse production of AMPs in epithelial tissues in response to FOXO may help modulating the defence reaction without harming the host tissues, in particular when animals are suffering from energy shortage or stress.",2010,Nature,64.8,Becker T,Hoch M,"Development, Genetics & Molecular Physiology Unit, LIMES Institute, University of Bonn, Carl-Troll-Strasse 31, D-53115 Bonn, Germany.",Germany

Induction of the Cecropin A1 gene by M. luteus required Relish, whereas induction of the Cecropin A2 gene required Dif.

A sequence homologous to mammalian interferon consensus response element enhances the activity of the diptericin promoter.,7537872,23,7,"Bacterial challenge of larvae or adults of Drosophila induces the rapid transcription of several genes encoding antibacterial peptides with a large spectrum of activity. One of these peptides, the 82-residue anti-gram negative diptericin, is encoded by a single intronless gene and we are investigating the control of expression of this gene. Previous studies using both transgenic experiments and footprint analysis have highlighted the role in the induction of this gene of a 30 nucleotide region which contains three partially overlapping motifs with sequence homology to mammalian NF-kappa B and NF-IL6 response elements and to the GAAANN sequence present in the interferon consensus response elements of some mammalian interferon-induced genes. We now show that the latter sequence binds in immune responsive tissues (fat body, blood cells) of Drosophila a approximately 45 kDa polypeptide which cross-reacts with a polyserum directed against mammalian interferon Regulatory Factor-I.

1403,Novakova M;Dolezal T,Expression of Drosophila adenosine deaminase in immune cells during inflammatory response.,21412432,6,3,"Extra-cellular adenosine is an important regulator of inflammatory responses. It is generated from released ATP by a cascade of ectoenzymes and degraded by adenosine deaminase (ADA). There are two types of enzymes with ADA activity: ADA1 and ADGF/ADA2. ADA2 activity originates from macrophages and dendritic cells and is associated with inflammatory responses in humans and rats. Drosophila possesses a family of six ADGF proteins with ADGF-A being the main regulator of extra-cellular adenosine during larval stages. Herein we present the generation of a GFP reporter for ADGF-A expression by a precise replacement of the ADGF-A coding sequence with GFP using homologous recombination. We show that the reporter is specifically expressed in aggregating hemocytes (Drosophila immune cells) forming melanotic capsules; a characteristic of inflammatory response. Our vital reporter thus confirms ADA expression in sites of inflammation in vivo and demonstrates that the requirement for ADA activity during inflammatory response is evolutionary conserved from insects to vertebrates. Our results also suggest that ADA activity is achieved specifically within sites of inflammation by an uncharacterized post-transcriptional regulation based mechanism. Utilizing various mutants that induce melanotic capsule formation and also a real immune challenge provided by parasitic wasps, we show that the acute expression of the ADGF-A protein is not driven by one specific signaling cascade but is rather associated with the behavior of immune cells during the general inflammatory response. Connecting the exclusive expression of ADGF-A within sites of inflammation, as presented here, with the release of energy stores when the ADGF-A activity is absent, suggests that extra-cellular adenosine may function as a signal for energy allocation during immune response and that ADGF-A/ADA2 expression in such sites of inflammation may regulate this role.",2011,PloS one,3.7,Novakova M,Dolezal T,"Department of Molecular Biology, Faculty of Science, University of South Bohemia, Ceske Budejovice, Czech Republic.",Czech Republic

Studies in Drosophila melanogaster have proved fruitful in determining the signals used to control NF-kappaB proteins, beginning with the discovery that the Toll/NF-kappaB pathway, in addition to patterning the dorsal-ventral axis of the fly embryo, defines a major component of the innate immune response in both Drosophila and mammals. Here, we characterize the Drosophila wntD (Wnt inhibitor of Dorsal) gene. We show that WntD acts as a feedback inhibitor of the NF-kappaB homologue Dorsal during both embryonic patterning and the innate immune response to infection. wntD expression is under the control of Toll/Dorsal signalling, and increased levels of WntD block Dorsal nuclear accumulation, even in the absence of the IkappaB homologue Cactus. The WntD signal is independent of the common Wnt signalling component Armadillo (beta-catenin). By engineering a gene knockout, we show that wntD loss-of-function mutants have immune defects and exhibit increased levels of Toll/Dorsal signalling. Furthermore, the wntD mutant phenotype is suppressed by loss of zygotic dorsal. These results describe the first secreted feedback antagonist of Toll signalling, and demonstrate a novel Wnt activity in the fly.",2005,Nature,64.8,Gordon MD,Nusse R,"Department of Developmental Biology, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Beckman Center and.",USA

The underlying mechanisms are insufficiently understood. To identify components of the RNAi pathway in S2 cells, we developed a screen based on rescue from RNAi-induced lethality. We identified Argonaute 2, a core component of the RNAi machinery, and three gene products previously unknown to be involved in RNAi in Drosophila: DEAD-box RNA helicase Belle, 26 S proteasome regulatory subunit 8 (Pros45), and clathrin heavy chain, a component of the endocytic machinery. Blocking endocytosis in S2 cells impaired RNAi, suggesting that dsRNA fragments are internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Indeed, using a candidate gene approach, we identified two Drosophila scavenger receptors, SR-CI and Eater, which together accounted for more than 90% of the dsRNA uptake into S2 cells. When expressed in mammalian cells, SR-CI was sufficient to mediate internalization of dsRNA fragments. Our data provide insight into the mechanism of dsRNA internalization by Drosophila cells.

Since the conjugation of SUMO occurs in many different proteins, a variety of cellular processes probably require lwr function. Here, we demonstrate that lwr function regulates the production of blood cells (hemocytes) in Drosophila larvae. lwr mutant larvae develop many melanotic tumors in the hemolymph at the third instar stage. The formation of melanotic tumors is due to a large number of circulating hemocytes, which is approximately 10 times higher than those of wild type. This overproduction of hemocytes is attributed to the loss of lwr function primarily in hemocytes and the lymph glands, a hematopoietic organ in Drosophila larvae. High incidences of Dorsal (Dl) protein in the nucleus were observed in lwr mutant hemocytes, and the dl and Dorsal-related immunity factor (Dif) mutations were found to be suppressors of the lwr mutation. Therefore, the lwr mutation leads to the activation of these Rel-related proteins, key transcription factors in hematopoiesis. We also demonstrate that dl and Dif play different roles in hematopoiesis. dl primarily stimulates plasmatocyte production, but Dif controls both plasmatocyte and lamellocyte production.",2005,Developmental biology,3.148,Huang L,Tanda S,"Department of Biological Sciences and Molecular and Cell Biology Program, Ohio University, Athens, 45701, USA.",USA
1716,Ayres JS;Schneider DS,A signaling protease required for melanization in Drosophila affects resistance and tolerance of infections.,19071960,6,12,"Organisms evolve two routes to surviving infections-they can resist pathogen growth (resistance) and they can endure the pathogenesis of infection (tolerance). The sum of these two properties together defines the defensive capabilities of the host. Typically, studies of animal defenses focus on either understanding resistance or, to a lesser extent, tolerance mechanisms, thus providing little understanding of the relationship between these two mechanisms. We suggest there are nine possible pairwise permutations of these traits, assuming they can increase, decrease, or remain unchanged in an independent manner. Here we show that by making a single mutation in the gene encoding a protease, CG3066, active in the melanization cascade in Drosophila melanogaster, we observe the full spectrum of changes; these mutant flies show increases and decreases in their resistance and tolerance properties when challenged with a variety of pathogens. This result implicates melanization in fighting microbial infections and shows that an immune response can affect both resistance and tolerance to infections in microbe-dependent ways. The fly is often described as having an unsophisticated and stereotypical immune response where single mutations cause simple binary changes in immunity. We report a level of complexity in the fly's immune response that has strong ecological implications. We suggest that immune responses are highly tuned by evolution, since selection for defenses that alter resistance against one pathogen may change both resistance and tolerance to other pathogens.",2008,PLoS biology,9.8,Ayres JS,Schneider DS,"Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, USA.",USA

Although critical to survival, coordinating protection against a foreign organism is energetically costly, creating the need to reallocate substrates from nonessential functions, such as growth and nutrient storage. However, the mechanism by which infection or inflammation leads to a reduction in energy utilization by these dispensable processes is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that activation of the Toll signaling pathway selectively in the fat body, the major immune and lipid storage organ of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, leads to both induction of immunity and reallocation of resources. Toll signaling in the fat body suppresses insulin signaling both within these cells and non-autonomously throughout the organism, leading to a decrease in both nutrient stores and growth.

One such mutant, which maps near the Black cells (Bc) gene, causes a severe impairment of the normal immune response, including attenuated induction of several immunity genes. Survival assays indicate a positive correlation between the induction of these genes, particularly diptericin, and resistance to bacterial infection. These studies are consistent with the notion that insect anti-microbial peptides work synergistically by binding distinct targets within infecting pathogens.

Of the 13 000 genes represented on the microarray, over 2500 exhibited significantly enriched transcription in haemocytes. Among these were genes encoding integrins, peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), scavenger receptors, lectins, cell adhesion molecules and serine proteases. One relevant outcome of this analysis was the gain of new insights into the lamellocyte encapsulation process. We showed that lamellocytes require betaPS integrin for encapsulation and that they transcribe one prophenoloxidase gene enabling them to produce the enzyme necessary for melanisation of the capsule. A second compelling observation was that following infection, the gene encoding the cytokine Spatzle was uniquely upregulated in haemocytes and not the fat body.

Secondary screens using Escherichia coli and latex beads revealed several genes specific for C. albicans phagocytosis. Characterization of one of those gene products, Macroglobulin complement related (Mcr), shows that it is secreted, that it binds specifically to the surface of C. albicans, and that it promotes its subsequent phagocytosis.

Here, we employ the model Drosophila melanogaster to dissect and identify early host responses that function in the initiation and progression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pathogenesis. First, we use immune potentiation and genetic studies to demonstrate that flies mount a heightened defense against the highly virulent P. aeruginosa strain PA14 when first inoculated with strain CF5, which is avirulent in flies; this effect is mediated via the Imd and Toll signaling pathways. Second, we use whole-genome expression profiling to assess and compare the Drosophila early defense responses triggered by the PA14 vs. CF5 strains to identify genes whose expression patterns are different in susceptible vs. resistant host-pathogen interactions, respectively. Our results identify pathogenesis- and defense-specific genes and uncover a previously undescribed mechanism used by P. aeruginosa in the initial stages of its host interaction: suppression of Drosophila defense responses by limiting antimicrobial peptide gene expression.

While many such factors exhibit enhanced activity under conditions that favor conjugation, the mechanisms behind this enhancement are largely unknown. We previously showed that the Drosophila melanogaster rel family factor, Dorsal, is a substrate for Smt3 conjugation. The conjugation machinery was found to enhance Dorsal activity at least in part by counteracting the Cactus-mediated inhibition of Dorsal nuclear localization. In this report, we show that Smt3 conjugation occurs at a single site in Dorsal (lysine 382), requires just the Smt3-activating and -conjugating enzymes, and is reversed by the deconjugating enzyme Ulp1. Mutagenesis of the acceptor lysine eliminates the response of Dorsal to the conjugation machinery and results in enhanced levels of synergistic transcriptional activation. Thus, in addition to controlling Dorsal localization, Smt3 also appears to regulate Dorsal-mediated activation, perhaps by modulating an interaction with a negatively acting nuclear factor. Finally, since Dorsal contributes to innate immunity, we examined the role of Smt3 conjugation in the immune response. We find that the conjugation machinery is required for lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of antimicrobial peptides in cultured cells and larvae, suggesting that Smt3 regulates Dorsal function in vivo.",2002,Molecular and cellular biology,5.3,Bhaskar V,Courey AJ,"Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095-1569, USA.",USA

Environmental studies have demonstrated a close association between V. cholerae and many species of arthropods including insects. Here we report the susceptibility of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, to oral V. cholerae infection through a process that exhibits many of the hallmarks of human disease: (i) death of the fly is dependent on the presence of cholera toxin and is preceded by rapid weight loss; (ii) flies harboring mutant alleles of either adenylyl cyclase, Gsalpha, or the Gardos K channel homolog SK are resistant to V. cholerae infection; and (iii) ingestion of a K channel blocker along with V. cholerae protects wild-type flies against death. In mammals, ingestion of as little as 25 mug of cholera toxin results in massive diarrhea. In contrast, we found that ingestion of cholera toxin was not lethal to the fly. However, when cholera toxin was co-administered with a pathogenic strain of V. cholerae carrying a chromosomal deletion of the genes encoding cholera toxin, death of the fly ensued. These findings suggest that additional virulence factors are required for intoxication of the fly that may not be essential for intoxication of mammals.

Several Drosophila PGRPs have lost this enzymatic activity and serve as microbe sensors through peptidoglycan recognition. Other PGRP family members, such as Drosophila PGRP-SC1 or mammalian PGRP-L, have conserved the amidase function and are able to cleave peptidoglycan in vitro. However, the contribution of these amidase PGRPs to host defense in vivo has remained elusive so far. Using an RNA-interference approach, we addressed the function of two PGRPs with amidase activity in the Drosophila immune response. We observed that PGRP-SC1/2-depleted flies present a specific over-activation of the IMD (immune deficiency) signaling pathway after bacterial challenge.

Specifically, we found that increasing the nutritional yeast (protein) available to larval Drosophila melanogaster increased the adult's constitutive transcription of two genes encoding defensive antimicrobial peptides. Adult dry weight was not significantly affected by larval food composition, while adult fat content decreased when larval yeast increased. Larval immune activity was unaffected by alterations of larval diet, indicating a lack of covariation in this trait across life-stages.

Two defense strategies protect hosts against infections: resistance, which is the ability to control pathogen levels, and tolerance, which helps the host endure infection-induced pathology. Here we show that infected fruit flies become anorexic and that diet restriction alters defenses, increasing the fly's tolerance to Salmonella typhimurium infections while decreasing resistance to Listeria monocytogenes.

The flies deficient in the ICAD gene did not express CAD, and did not undergo apoptotic DNA fragmentation during embryogenesis and oogenesis. In contrast, the deficiency of DNase II enhanced the apoptotic DNA fragmentation in the embryos and ovary, but paradoxically, the mutant flies accumulated a large amount of DNA, particularly in the ovary. This accumulation of DNA in the DNase II mutants caused the constitutive expression of the antibacterial genes for diptericin and attacin, which are usually activated during bacterial infection. The expression of these genes was further enhanced in flies lacking both dICAD and DNase II.

Although conserved regulatory pathways have been defined, calcineurin, a Ca(2+)-dependent phosphatase, has not been previously implicated in Drosophila immunity. Calcineurin activates mammalian immune responses by activating the nuclear translocation of the vertebrate-specific transcription factors NFAT1-4. In Drosophila, infection with gram-negative bacteria promotes the activation of the Relish transcription factor through the Imd pathway. The activity of this pathway in the larva is modulated by nitric oxide (NO). Here, we show that the input by NO is mediated by calcineurin. Pharmacological inhibition of calcineurin suppressed the Relish-dependent gene expression that occurs in response to gram-negative bacteria or NO. One of the three calcineurin genes in Drosophila, CanA1, mediated NO-induced nuclear translocation of Relish in a cell-culture assay. A CanA1 RNA interference (RNAi) transgene suppressed immune induction in larvae upon infection or upon treatment with NO donors, whereas a gain-of-function CanA1 transgene activated immune responses in untreated larvae. Interestingly, CanA1 RNAi in hemocytes but not the fat body was sufficient to block immune induction in the fat body. Thus, CanA1 provides an additional input into Relish-promoted immune responses and functions in hemocytes to promote a tissue-to-tissue signaling cascade required for robust immune response.",2007,Current biology : CB,9.2,Dijkers PF,O'Farrell PH,"Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143-2200, USA.",USA

In a model of septic injury, if directly introduced into the body cavity of Drosophila, this pathogen is insensitive to the host's systemic immune response and kills flies in a day. We find that S. marcescens resistance to the Drosophila immune deficiency (imd)-mediated humoral response requires the bacterial lipopolysaccharide O-antigen. If ingested by Drosophila, bacteria cross the gut and penetrate the body cavity. During this passage, the bacteria can be observed within the cells of the intestinal epithelium. In such an oral infection model, the flies succumb to infection only after 6 days. We demonstrate that two complementary host defense mechanisms act together against such food-borne infection: an antimicrobial response in the intestine that is regulated by the imd pathway and phagocytosis by hemocytes of bacteria that have escaped into the hemolymph. Interestingly, bacteria present in the hemolymph elicit a systemic immune response only when phagocytosis is blocked. Our observations support a model wherein peptidoglycan fragments released during bacterial growth activate the imd pathway and do not back a proposed role for phagocytosis in the immune activation of the fat body.

However, the effects of hypercapnia on non-neuronal tissues and the mechanisms that mediate these effects are largely unknown. Here, we develop Drosophila as a genetically tractable model for defining non-neuronal CO(2) responses and response pathways. We show that hypercapnia significantly impairs embryonic morphogenesis, egg laying, and egg hatching even in mutants lacking the Gr63a neuronal CO(2) sensor. Consistent with previous reports that hypercapnic acidosis can suppress mammalian NF-kappaB-regulated innate immune genes, we find that in adult flies and the phagocytic immune-responsive S2* cell line, hypercapnia suppresses induction of specific antimicrobial peptides that are regulated by Relish, a conserved Rel/NF-kappaB family member. Correspondingly, modest hypercapnia (7-13%) increases mortality of flies inoculated with E. faecalis, A. tumefaciens, or S. aureus. During E. faecalis and A. tumefaciens infection, increased bacterial loads were observed, indicating that hypercapnia can decrease host resistance. Hypercapnic immune suppression is not mediated by acidosis, the olfactory CO(2) receptor Gr63a, or by nitric oxide signaling. Further, hypercapnia does not induce responses characteristic of hypoxia, oxidative stress, or heat shock. Finally, proteolysis of the Relish IkappaB-like domain is unaffected by hypercapnia, indicating that immunosuppression acts downstream of, or in parallel to, Relish proteolytic activation. Our results suggest that hypercapnic immune suppression is mediated by a conserved response pathway, and illustrate a mechanism by which hypercapnia could contribute to worse outcomes of patients with advanced lung disease, who frequently suffer from both hypercapnia and respiratory infections.",2009,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,11.1,Helenius IT,Beitel GJ,"Department of Biochemistry, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA.",USA
2737,Bernal A;Kimbrell DA,Drosophila Thor participates in host immune defense and connects a translational regulator with innate immunity.,10811906,97,11,"Thor has been identified as a new type of gene involved in Drosophila host immune defense. Thor is a member of the 4E-binding protein (4E-BP) family, which in mammals has been defined as critical regulators in a pathway that controls initiation of translation through binding eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). Without an infection, Thor is expressed during all developmental stages and transcripts localize to a wide variety of tissues, including the reproductive system. In response to bacterial infection and, to a lesser extent, by wounding, Thor is up-regulated. The Thor promoter has the canonical NFkappaB and associated GATA recognition sequences that have been shown to be essential for immune induction, as well as other sequences commonly found for Drosophila immune response genes, including interferon-related regulatory sequences. In survival tests, Thor mutants show symptoms of being immune compromised, indicating that Thor may be critical in host defense. In contrast to Thor, Drosophila eIF4E is not induced by bacterial infection. These findings for Thor provide the first evidence that a 4E-BP family member has a role in immune induction in any organism. Further, no gene in the translation initiation pathway that includes 4E-BP has been previously found to be immune induced. Our results suggest either a role for translational regulation in humoral immunity or a new, nontranslational function for 4E-BP type genes.",2000,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,11.1,Bernal A,Kimbrell DA,"Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Rice University, 6100 Main Street, Houston, TX 77005, USA.",USA

This phenotype is similar to the phenotypes generated by mutations in components of the Drosophila Imd pathway. Our genetic studies also indicate that dTAK1 functions downstream of the Imd protein and upstream of the IKK complex in the Imd pathway that controls the Rel/NF-kappaB like transactivator Relish. In addition, our epistatic analysis places the caspase, Dredd, downstream of the IKK complex, which supports the idea that Relish is processed and activated by a caspase activity.

It has been proposed that the two pathways have independent functions and mediate the specificity of innate immune responses towards different microorganisms. Scattered evidence also suggests that some antimicrobial target genes can be activated by both Toll and IMD, albeit to different extents. This dual activation can be mediated by independent stimulation or by cross-regulation of the two pathways. We show in this report that the Toll and IMD pathways can interact synergistically, demonstrating that cross-regulation occurs. The presence of Spätzle (the Toll ligand) and gram-negative peptidoglycan (the PGRP-LC ligand) together caused synergistic activation of representative target genes of the two pathways, including Drosomycin, Diptericin, and AttacinA. Constitutive activation of Toll and PGRP-LC/IMD could mimic the synergistic stimulation.

Although considerable analysis has permitted the elucidation of mechanisms pertaining to the two responses individually, the mechanism of their coordination has been unclear. To characterise the signals with which infection might be communicated between blood cells and fat body, we ablated circulating haemocytes and defined the parameters of AMP gene activation in larvae. We found that targeted ablation of blood cells influenced the levels of AMP gene expression in the fat body following both septic injury and oral infection. Expression of the AMP gene drosomycin (a Toll target) was blocked when expression of the Toll ligand Spätzle was knocked down in haemocytes.

In Drosophila, the Toll pathway (activated by fungi and gram-positive bacteria) and the Imd pathway (activated by gram-negative bacteria) lead to the synthesis of AMPs. But AMP genes are also regulated without pathogenic challenge, e.g., by aging, circadian rhythms, and mating. Here, we show that AMP genes are differentially expressed in mated females. Metchnikowin (Mtk) expression is strongly stimulated in the first 6 hr after mating. Sex-peptide (SP), a male seminal peptide transferred during copulation, is the major agent eliciting transcription of Mtk and of other AMP genes. Both pathways are needed for Mtk induction by SP. Furthermore, SP induces additional AMP genes via the Toll (Drosomycin) and the Imd (Diptericin) pathways. SP affects the Toll pathway at or upstream of the gene spätzle, the Imd pathway at or upstream of the gene imd. Mating may physically damage females and pathogens may be transferred.

Following immune-challenge, a proteolytic cascade is activated which signals through the Toll receptor. Toll activation results in a range of antibiotic peptides being synthesised in the fat-body and exported to the haemolymph. As with mammalian serpins, Necrotic turnover in Drosophila is rapid. This serpin is synthesised in the fat-body, but its site of degradation has been unclear. By ""freezing"" endocytosis with a temperature sensitive Dynamin mutation, we demonstrate that Necrotic is removed from the haemolymph in two groups of giant cells: the garland and pericardial athrocytes. Necrotic uptake responds rapidly to infection, being visibly increased after 30 mins and peaking at 6-8 hours. Co-localisation of anti-Nec with anti-AP50, Rab5, and Rab7 antibodies establishes that the serpin is processed through multi-vesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localises with the ubiquitin-binding protein, HRS. Nec does not co-localise with Rab11, indicating that the serpin is not re-exported from athrocytes. Instead, mutations which block late endosome/lysosome fusion (dor, hk, and car) cause accumulation of Necrotic-positive endosomes, even in the absence of infection. Knockdown of the 6 Drosophila orthologues of the mammalian LDL receptor family with dsRNA identifies LpR1 as an enhancer of the immune response. Uptake of Necrotic from the haemolymph is blocked by a chromosomal deletion of LpR1. In conclusion, we identify the cells and the receptor molecule responsible for the uptake and degradation of the Necrotic serpin in Drosophila melanogaster.

Genetic studies in Dictyostelium demonstrated that Phg1A is required for cell adhesion and phagocytosis. We created Phg1A/TM9SF4-null mutant flies and showed that they were sensitive to pathogenic Gram-negative, but not Gram-positive, bacteria. This increased sensitivity was not due to impaired Toll or Imd signalling, but rather to a defective cellular immune response. TM9SF4-null larval macrophages phagocytosed Gram-negative E. coli inefficiently, although Gram-positive S. aureus were phagocytosed normally. Mutant larvae also had a decreased wasp egg encapsulation rate, a process requiring haemocyte-dependent adhesion to parasitoids. Defective cellular immunity was coupled to morphological and adhesion defects in mutant larval haemocytes, which had an abnormal actin cytoskeleton. TM9SF4, and its closest paralogue TM9SF2, were both required for bacterial internalisation in S2 cells, where they displayed partial redundancy.

To obtain an overview of the lysozyme genes in this species and their possible roles in immunity and digestion, we have now characterized all six lysozyme genes in the cloned part of the lysozyme locus at 61F, and a seventh gene that maps to the same chromosomal location. The expression of the genes follows four different patterns: firstly, four closely related genes, LysB, C, D and E, are all strongly expressed in the midgut of larvae and adults; secondly, LysP is expressed in the adult salivary gland; thirdly, LysS is expressed mainly in the gastric caecae of larvae; and finally, LysX is primarily expressed in the metamorphosing midgut of late larvae and early pupae. The LysD-like genes and LysS are strongly repressed in artificially infected animals, possibly reflecting a malaise reaction in the digestive tract. None of the genes is expressed in the fat body or haemocytes. Thus rather than being a component of the haemolymph, the Drosophila lysozymes are found mainly in the digestive tract where they are expressed at a high level.

Here we show that JH and 20E have antagonistic effects on the induction of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes in Drosophila melanogaster. 20E pretreatment of Schneider S2 cells promoted the robust induction of AMP genes, following immune stimulation. On the other hand, JH III, and its synthetic analogs (JHa) methoprene and pyriproxyfen, strongly interfered with this 20E-dependent immune potentiation, although these hormones did not inhibit other 20E-induced cellular changes. Similarly, in vivo analyses in adult flies confirmed that JH is a hormonal immuno-suppressor. RNA silencing of either partner of the ecdysone receptor heterodimer (EcR or Usp) in S2 cells prevented the 20E-induced immune potentiation. In contrast, silencing methoprene-tolerant (Met), a candidate JH receptor, did not impair immuno-suppression by JH III and JHa, indicating that in this context MET is not a necessary JH receptor.

The ability of virgin females and females mated to SP lacking or control males to clear bacteria was assayed using an established technique in which Escherichia coli are injected directly into the fly body and the rate of clearance of the injected bacteria is determined. We found no repeatable differences in clearance rates between virgin females and females mated to SP producing or SP lacking males. However, we found that the piercing of the integument, as occurs during injection, up-regulates AMP gene expression much more strongly than SP.

These data are in contrast to previous studies, which suggest that mating can reduce a fly's ability to survive an actual bacterial challenge (realized immunity). This pattern may be driven by some aspect of mating, independent of resource limitation, which reduces immune function by inhibiting the effective deployment of immune gene products. Though several studies have examined both the potential and the realized immunity after mating, none have examined these immune measures simultaneously. Here, we examined the link between the potential and the realized immunity in a sterile mutant of D. melanogaster.

In the present study we report a modified approach for high-level expression of drosomycin, which allows us to evaluate its differential potency on the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa WT (wild type) and N. crassa MUT16, a specific resistance mutant strain to plant defensins, by using different approaches. The results presented here show for the first time that N. crassa MUT16 is resistant to our recombinant drosomycin. Differential survival rates of Drosophila larvae infected by N. crassa WT and MUT16 further confirm the key antifungal role of drosomycin in vivo. The absence of activity against MUT16 suggests a mechanical commonality between drosomycin and plant defensins, which provides additional evidence in favor of their homologous relationship. Furthermore, the existence of drosomycin-like molecules in fungi suggests that all these peptides could originate from a common ancestry rather than horizontal gene transfer between plants and insects, which is further strengthened by the monophyletic origin of these peptides from plants, fungi and insects.",2008,Insect molecular biology,2.6,Gao B,Zhu SY,"Group of Animal Innate Immunity, State Key Laboratory of Integrated Management of Pest Insects & Rodents, Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100101, China.",China

A peptidoglycan recognition protein, PGRP, has been cloned from moths as well as vertebrates and has been shown to participate in peptidoglycan-mediated activation of prophenoloxidase in the silk moth. Here we report that Drosophila expresses 12 PGRP genes, distributed in 8 chromosomal loci on the 3 major chromosomes. By analyzing cDNA clones and genomic databases, we grouped them into two classes: PGRP-SA, SB1, SB2, SC1A, SC1B, SC2, and SD, with short transcripts and short 5'-untranslated regions; and PGRP-LA, LB, LC, LD, and LE, with long transcripts and long 5'-untranslated regions. The predicted structures indicate that the first group encodes extracellular proteins and the second group, intracellular and membrane-spanning proteins. Most PGRP genes are expressed in all postembryonic stages. Peptidoglycan injections strongly induce five of the genes. Transcripts from the different PGRP genes were found in immune competent organs such as fat body, gut, and hemocytes.

However, we show here that priming Drosophila with a sublethal dose of Streptococcus pneumoniae protects against an otherwise-lethal second challenge of S. pneumoniae. This protective effect exhibits coarse specificity for S. pneumoniae and persists for the life of the fly. Although not all microbial challenges induced this specific primed response, we find that a similar specific protection can be elicited by Beauveria bassiana, a natural fly pathogen. To characterize this primed response, we focused on S. pneumoniae-induced protection. The mechanism underlying this protective effect requires phagocytes and the Toll pathway.

Their transcription may therefore require additional modifications of Relish. However, phosphorylation of the conserved serine residue S431 is not involved in such modifications. This is unlike p65 and Dorsal, which are modulated by phosphorylation at their homologous site.

Although the infection-dependent activation mechanisms of the Drosophila immune system are well understood, its inhibitory regulation remains elusive. To find novel suppressors of the immune system, we performed a genetic screening for Drosophila mutants with hyperactivated immune responses and isolated a loss-of-function mutant of caspar whose product is homologous to Fas-associating factor 1 in mammals. Interestingly, caspar mutant flies showed increased antibacterial immune responses including increased resistance to bacterial infection and a constitutive expression of diptericin, a representative antibacterial peptide gene. Conversely, ectopic expression of caspar strongly suppressed the infection-dependent gene expression of diptericin, which allowed bacterial outgrowth. Consistent with these physiological phenotypes, Caspar negatively regulated the immune deficiency (Imd)-mediated immune responses by blocking nuclear translocation of Relish, an NF-kappaB transcription factor. In addition, we further demonstrated that Dredd-dependent cleavage of Relish, a prerequisite event for the nuclear entry of Relish, is the target of the Caspar-mediated suppression of the Imd pathway. Remarkably, Caspar was highly specific for the Imd pathway and did not affect the Toll pathway, which is crucial for antifungal immunity.

In Drosophila the synthesis of these peptides is a highly regulated process allowing their rapid release in the hemolymph upon contact with pathogens and the arrest of their production after pathogen clearance. We observed that AMPep genes have either a transient or sustained expression profile in S2 Drosophila cells treated with peptidoglycan. Moreover, AMPep genes containing AU-rich elements (ARE) in their 3'-untranslated region (UTR) are subject to a post-transcriptional control affecting mRNA stability, thereby contributing to their transient expression profile. Cecropin A1 (CecA1) constitutes the prototype of this latter class of AMPeps. CecA1 mRNA bears in its 3'-UTR an ARE similar to class II AREs found in several short-lived mammalian mRNAs. In response to immune deficiency cascade signaling activated by Gram-negative peptidoglycans, CecA1 mRNA is transiently stabilized and subsequently submitted to deadenylation and decay mediated by the ARE present in its 3'-UTR. The functionality of CecA1 ARE relies on its ability to recruit TIS11 protein, which accelerates CecA1 mRNA deadenylation and decay. Moreover, we observed that CecA1 mRNA deadenylation is a biphasic process.

Using inducible assays for nucleocytoplasmic trafficking we show that mRNA export and classic NLS-mediated protein import are unaffected in mbo mutants. Instead, mbo is selectively required for the nuclear import of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 in a subset of the larval tissues. We have identified the first endogenous targets of the mbo nuclear import pathway in the Rel proteins Dorsal and Dif. In mbo mutants the upstream signaling events leading to the degradation of the IkappaB homolog Cactus are functional, but Dorsal and Dif remain cytoplasmic and the larval immune response is not activated in response to infection.

Here we show that mutants that lack the Drosophila Rel/NF-kappaB proteins Dorsal and Dif have very few blood cells, are constitutively infected by opportunistic microbes, and die from infection as larvae. When the double mutants are grown in microbe-free conditions, the animals are rescued from chronic infection and many survive to adult stages. Thus, Dif and Dorsal are required for survival because they protect the animal from infection by microbes from the environment. Specific expression of Dif or dorsal in the blood cell lineage is sufficient to restore blood cell number, clear microbes, and allow survival to the adult stage. These findings demonstrate that the cellular immune response is essential for the ability of Drosophila to survive in their standard laboratory environment, and that Dif and Dorsal control crucial aspects of the cellular immune response, including blood cell survival and the ability to fight off microbial infection.",2006,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,11.1,Matova N,Anderson KV,"Developmental Biology Program, Sloan-Kettering Institute, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.",USA

High levels of Rel protein-mediated Cecropin A1 expression previously have been shown to require the GATA site along with the kappaB site. We provide evidence demonstrating that the GATA motif is needed for expression of the Cecropin A1 gene in larval fat body, but is dispensable in adult fat body. A nuclear DNA-binding activity interacts with the Cecropin A1 GATA motif with the same properties as the Drosophila GATA factor Serpent. The GATA-binding activity is recognized by Serpent-specific antibodies, demonstrating their identity. We show that Serpent is nuclear in larval fat body cells and haemocytes both before and after infection. After overexpression, Serpent increases Cecropin A1 transcription in a GATA-dependent manner.

It is likely that genes involved in wound healing are conserved through the phylogeny and therefore, Drosophila may be an useful in vivo model system to identify genes necessary during this process. Furthermore, epithelial movement during specific developmental processes, such as dorsal closure, ressembles of those seen in mammalian wound healing. As puckered (puc) gene is a target of the JUN N-terminal kinase signaling pathway during dorsal closure, we investigated puc gene expression during wound healing in Drosophila. We showed that puc gene expression is induced at the edge of the wound in epithelial cells and Jun kinase is phosphorylated in wounded epidermal tissues, suggesting that the JUN N-terminal kinase signaling pathway is activated by a signal produced by an epidermal wound. In the absence of the Drosophila c-Fos homologue, puc gene expression is no longer induced. Finally, impaired epithelial repair in JUN N-terminal kinase deficient flies demonstrates that the JUN N-terminal kinase signaling is required to initiate the cell shape change at the onset of the epithelial wound healing. We conclude that the embryonic JUN N-terminal kinase gene cassette is induced at the edge of the wound.

Functional differentiation between them was further evaluated by evolutionary trace analysis which identified two evolutionary epitopes (named alpha- and gamma-patch, respectively) and an important site in the m-loop.

The presence of a defective peptidoglycan-docking groove, while preserving a unique role in mediating monomeric peptidoglycan induction of immune response, suggests that PGRP-LCa recognizes the exposed structural features of a monomeric muropeptide when the latter is bound to and presented by the ectodomain of PGRP-LCx.

With age, D. melanogaster progressively express higher levels of many antimicrobial peptides. It is unknown, however, whether this pattern reflects age-dependent changes in the function of the immune system itself or arises simply because aged adults have greater cumulative exposure to pathogens. Here we demonstrate that aged D. melanogaster transcribe more antimicrobial diptericin when experimentally exposed to septic bacterial infections. This strong net response in older females is the result of persistent diptericin transcription upon septic exposure, whereas young females rapidly terminate this induction. In contrast to their response to septic exposure, when exposed to killed bacteria aged females have less capacity to induce diptericin. Because this functional capacity of innate immunity declines with age, we conclude that female Drosophila undergo immune senescence. Furthermore, we show that fecundity is reduced by induction of innate immunity via the immune deficiency pathway. Consequently, maximum reproduction will occur when the immune response is tightly controlled in young females, even if this increases infection risk at later ages.",2005,Aging cell,7.8,Zerofsky M,Tatar M,"Brown University, Division of Biology and Medicine, Providence, RI 02912, USA.",USA

Using GFP-Dorsal, -Dif, and -Relish reporter proteins in ex vivo assays, we demonstrate that Drosophila fat bodies, a major immune tissue, have both hemolymph-dependent and -independent responses. Microbial preparations such as lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan (PGN) can stimulate some responses from dissected and rinsed larval fat bodies. Therefore, at least some aspects of recognition can occur on fat body cell surfaces, bypassing the requirement of hemolymph. Our results also show that supernatants from bacterial cultures can stimulate the nuclear translocation of Dorsal in dissected fat bodies, but this stimulation is strictly hemolymph-dependent. Various biochemical assays suggest that the factors from bacterial supernatants that stimulate the hemolymph-dependent nuclear translocation are likely made up of proteins.

In this study we examine the fitness consequences of immune challenge in female Drosophila melanogaster by examining both direct (within generation) and indirect (between generations) costs and benefits of immune challenge. Though passing immunity to offspring has been studied in mammals for many years, only recently have researchers found evidence for a cross-generational priming response in invertebrates. By examining both potential fitness costs and benefits in the next generation, we were able to determine what effect immune challenge has on fitness. In agreement with other studies, we found a direct cost to infection, where immune challenged females laid fewer eggs than unchallenged females in two of the three lines we examined. In addition, we found some evidence for indirect costs. Offspring from immune challenged mothers had shorter lifespans than those from unchallenged mothers in two of the three lines. Interestingly, we do not see any effect of maternal immune challenge on offspring's ability to overcome an infection, nor do we see an effect on other fitness traits measured, including egg size, egg-adult viability and offspring resistance to oxidative stress.

Drosophila has appeared in recent years as a favorable model to study this innate host defense. A genetic analysis of the regulation of the antifungal peptide drosomycin has demonstrated a key role for the transmembrane receptor Toll, which prompted the search for mammalian homologs. Two of these, Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4, recently were shown to play a critical role in innate immunity against bacteria. Here we describe six additional Toll-related genes (Toll-3 to Toll-8) in Drosophila in addition to 18-wheeler. Two of these genes, Toll-3 and Toll-4, are expressed at a low level. Toll-6, -7, and -8, on the other hand, are expressed at high levels during embryogenesis and molting, suggesting that, like Toll and 18w, they perform developmental functions. Finally, Toll-5 is expressed only in larvae and adults. By using chimeric constructs, we have tested the capacity of the signaling Toll/IL-1R homology domains of these receptors to activate antimicrobial peptide promoters and found that only Toll and Toll-5 can activate the drosomycin promoter in transfected cells, thus demonstrating specificity at the level of the Toll/IL-1R homology domain. In contrast, none of these constructs activated antibacterial peptide promoters, suggesting that Toll-related receptors are not involved in the regulation of antibacterial peptide expression.

This modification is blocked in PGRP-SA(semmelweiss) mutants after Gram-positive bacterial challenge and in persephone mutants after fungal or Gram-positive bacterial challenge, indicating that activation of either of the Toll pathway upstream branches induces N-terminal cleavage of the serpin. The absolute requirement of persephone gene product for this cleavage indicates that Gram-positive bacteria activate a redundant set of proteinases upstream of Toll. Both full-length Necrotic and the core serpin are active inhibitors of a range of serine proteinases: the highest affinity being for cathepsin G and elastases. We found a 13-fold increase in the specificity of the core serpin over that of full-length Necrotic for one of the tested proteinases (porcine pancreatic elastase).

RNA interference and overexpression experiments demonstrated that Listericin gene induction is cooperatively regulated by PGRP-LE and the JAK-STAT (Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway. An in vitro cell culture assay showed that Listericin is secreted as processed forms and suppresses the growth of L. monocytogenes and Gram-negative bacteria. A colony formation unit assay clearly demonstrated that induction of the Listericin gene suppresses not only the growth of L. monocytogenes but also the growth of Gram-negative bacteria in vivo.

Dif and Dorsal act in circulating blood cells, where they are required autonomously to promote blood-cell survival and phagocytosis of microorganisms. We show that a major transcriptional target of Dorsal and Dif in blood cells is Drosophila IAP1, a gene protecting these cells from death. We find that in addition to their autonomous role in blood-cell survival, Dif and Dorsal also act in the fat body to produce factors that promote blood-cell viability. These Rel proteins act in the epidermis to prevent infection by maintaining a barrier to microbial entry. Dorsal or Dif in any one of the three tissues is sufficient to defend the animal from opportunistic infection. Thus Drosophila has a multi-pronged system of defense and each branch of this network requires Rel proteins.

Under normal developmental conditions and in wild-type genetic backgrounds, Drosophila possesses two types of blood cells, crystal cells and plasmatocytes. Upon infestation by a parasitic wasp or in certain altered genetic backgrounds, a third hemocyte class called the lamellocyte becomes apparent. Herein we describe the characterization of a novel transcriptional regulatory module, a lamellocyte-active enhancer of the misshapen gene. This transcriptional control sequence appears to be inactive in all cell types of the wild-type larva, including crystal cells and plasmatocytes. However, in lamellocytes induced by wasp infestation or by particular genetic conditions, the enhancer is activated and it directs reporter GFP or DsRed expression exclusively in lamellocytes. The lamellocyte control region was delimited to a 140-bp intronic sequence that contains an essential DNA recognition element for the AP-1 transcription factor. Additionally, mutation of the kayak gene encoding the dFos subunit of AP-1 led to a strong suppression of lamellocyte production in tumorous larvae. As misshapen encodes a protein kinase within the Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway that functions to form an active AP-1 complex, the lamellocyte-active enhancer likely serves as a transcriptional target within a genetic auto-regulatory circuit that promotes the production of lamellocytes in immune-challenged or genetically-compromised animals.",2009,PloS one,3.7,Tokusumi T,Schulz RA,"Department of Biological Sciences, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana, United States of America.",USA

The plasmatocytes, one class of hemocytes, are phagocytically active and play an important role in immunity and development by removing microorganisms as well as apoptotic cells. On the surface of circulating and sessile plasmatocytes, we have now identified a protein, Nimrod C1 (NimC1), which is involved in the phagocytosis of bacteria. Suppression of NimC1 expression in plasmatocytes inhibited the phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus. Conversely, overexpression of NimC1 in S2 cells stimulated the phagocytosis of both S. aureus and Escherichia coli. NimC1 is a 90-100 kDa single-pass transmembrane protein with ten characteristic EGF-like repeats (NIM repeats). The nimC1 gene is part of a cluster of ten related nimrod genes at 34E on chromosome 2, and similar clusters of nimrod-like genes are conserved in other insects such as Anopheles and Apis. The Nimrod proteins are related to other putative phagocytosis receptors such as Eater and Draper from D. melanogaster and CED-1 from C. elegans. Together, they form a superfamily that also includes proteins that are encoded in the human genome.",2007,Current biology : CB,9.2,Kurucz E,Andó I,"Institute of Genetics, Biological Research Center of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, H-6701 Szeged, Hungary.",Hungary
