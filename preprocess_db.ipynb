         "The cellular events in the formation of melanotic tumors in the tu-W mutant larva of Drosophila melanogaster are described. The first step is the differentiation of spherical hemocytes to flattened cells, the lamellocyte variants. Subsequently, the surface of the caudal fat body undergoes changes to which the hemocytes respond by forming cellular capsules. The hemocytes utilize two mechanisms in this process: (1) phagocytosis of small particulate materials escaping from the adipose cells, (2) adhesion to form a multilayered wall of lamellocytes. Differentiating hemocytes in the vicinity of the tumor-forming site extrude membrane-bound vesicles that tend to adhere to the hemocyte surfaces. These vesicles are trapped between the lamellocytes as they pile in layers to form the capsule wall. It is suggested that the vesicles play a role in lamellocyte-to-lamellocyte adhesion during the initial stages of hemocyte aggregation at the tumor-forming site.",

However, recent evidence suggests that IAPs are multifunctional signaling devices that influence diverse biological processes. To investigate the in vivo function of Drosophila melanogaster IAP2, we have generated diap2 null alleles. diap2 mutant animals develop normally and are fully viable, suggesting that diap2 is dispensable for proper development. However, these animals were acutely sensitive to infection by gram-negative bacteria. In Drosophila, infection by gram-negative bacteria triggers the innate immune response by activating the immune deficiency (imd) signaling cascade, a NF-kappaB-dependent pathway that shares striking similarities with the pathway of mammalian tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1). diap2 mutant flies failed to activate NF-kappaB-mediated expression of antibacterial peptide genes and, consequently, rapidly succumbed to bacterial infection. Our genetic epistasis analysis places diap2 downstream of or in parallel to imd, Dredd, Tak1, and Relish. Therefore, DIAP2 functions in the host immune response to gram-negative bacteria. In contrast, we find that the Drosophila TNFR-associated factor (Traf) family member Traf2 is dispensable in resistance to gram-negative bacterial infection. Taken together, our genetic data identify DIAP2 as an essential component of the Imd signaling cascade, protecting the organism from infiltrating microbes.",

         "Eukaryotic organisms use a similar Rel/NF-kappaB signaling cascade for the induction of innate immune genes. In Drosophila, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal-induced activation of the Rel/NF-kappaB family transcription factors is an essential step in the transcriptional activation of inducible antimicrobial peptide genes. However, the mechanism by which the LPS-induced signaling pathway proceeds remains largely unknown. Here we have cloned a novel Drosophila LPS-activated kinase (DLAK) that is structurally related to mammalian IkappaB kinases. DLAK is expressed and transiently activated in LPS-responsive Drosophila cells following LPS stimulation. Furthermore, DLAK can interact with Cactus, a Drosophila IkappaB and phosphorylate recombinant Cactus, in vitro. Overexpression of dominant-negative mutant DLAK (DLAK(K50A)) blocks LPS-induced Cactus degradation. DLAK-bound Cactus can be degraded in a LPS signal-dependent fashion, whereas the DLAK(K50A) mutant-bound Cactus is completely resistant to degradation in the presence of LPS. The DLAK(K50A) mutant also inhibits nuclear kappaB binding activity and kappaB-dependent diptericin reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner, but the kappaB-dependent diptericin reporter gene activity can be rescued by overexpression of wild type DLAK. Moreover, mRNA analysis of various kappaB-dependent antimicrobial peptide genes shows that LPS inducibility of these genes is greatly impaired in cells overexpressing DLAK(K50A). These results establish that DLAK is a novel LPS-activated kinase, which is an essential signaling component for the induction of antimicrobial peptide genes following LPS treatment in Drosophila cells.",

         "Innate immunity in Drosophila is characterized by the inducible expression of antimicrobial peptides. We have investigated the development and regulation of immune responsiveness in Drosophila embryos after infection. Immune competence, as monitored by the induction of Cecropin A1-lacZ constructs, was observed first in the embryonic yolk. This observation suggests that the yolk plays an important role in the humoral immune response of the developing embryo by synthesizing antimicrobial peptides. Around midembryogenesis, the response in the yolk was diminished. Simultaneously, Cecropin expression became inducible in a large number of cells in the epidermis, demonstrating that late-stage embryos can synthesize their own antibiotics in the epidermis. This production likely serves to provide the hatching larva with an active antimicrobial barrier and protection against systemic infections. Cecropin expression in the yolk required the presence of a GATA site in the promoter as well as the involvement of the GATA-binding transcription factor Serpent (dGATAb). In contrast, neither the GATA site nor Serpent were necessary for Cecropin expression in the epidermis. Thus, the inducible immune responses in the yolk and in the epidermis can be uncoupled and call for distinct sets of transcription factors. Our data suggest that Serpent is involved in the distinction between a systemic response in the yolk/fat body and a local immune response in epithelial cells. In addition, the present study shows that signal transduction pathways controlling innate and epithelial defense reactions can be dissected genetically in Drosophila embryos.",

We have found that DmUbc9 binds and conjugates Drosophila Smt3 (DmSmt3) to Dorsal. In cultured cells, DmUbc9 was found to relieve inhibition of Dorsal nuclear uptake by Cactus, allowing Dorsal to enter the nucleus and activate transcription. The effect of DmUbc9 on Dorsal activity was potentiated by the overexpression of DmSmt3. We have also identified a DmSmt3-activating enzyme, DmSAE1/DmSAE2 and found that it further potentiates Dorsal-mediated activation.",

In the present, we report the physical interaction between GNBP1 and PGRP-SA using recombinant proteins. GNBP1 was able to hydrolyze Gram-positive peptidoglycan (PG), while PGRP-SA bound highly purified PG fragments (muropeptides). Interaction between these proteins was enhanced in the presence of PG or muropeptides. PGRP-SA binding depended on the polymerization status of the muropeptides, pointing to constraints in the number of PGRP-SA molecules bound for signaling initiation. We propose a model whereby GNBP1 presents a processed form of PG for sensing by PGRP-SA and that a tripartite interaction between these proteins and PG is essential for downstream signaling.",

To gain insight into the role of ird1 in the immune response, we examine how amino acid starvation affects the immune signalling pathways in Drosophila. Starvation, in the absence of infection, leads to expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes and this response is dependent on ird1 and the Imd immune signalling pathway. Starvation, in addition to bacterial infection, suppresses the AMP response in wild-type animals and reduces the ability to survive M. luteus infection. Our results suggest that starvation and innate immune signalling may be intimately linked processes.",

Survival rates post-infection, after a fungal or bacterial infection, varied according to the combination of signaling pathway (Toll and Imd) and sex tested.

Drosophila uses two distinct immune signaling pathways, the Toll and immune deficiency (Imd) pathways, to respond to different classes of microbes. The Toll pathway is predominantly activated by Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, while the Imd pathway is primarily activated by Gram-negative bacteria. Recent work has suggested that this differential activation is achieved through peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-mediated recognition of specific forms of peptidoglycan (PG). In this study, we have further analyzed the specific PG molecular requirements for Imd activation through the pattern recognition receptor PGRP-LC in both cultured cell line and in flies. We found that two signatures of Gram-negative PG, the presence of diaminopimelic acid in the peptide bridge and a 1,6-anhydro form of N-acetylmuramic acid in the glycan chain, allow discrimination between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Our results also point to a role for PG oligomerization in Imd activation, and we demonstrate that elements of both the sugar backbone and the peptide bridge of PG are required for optimum recognition. Altogether, these results indicate multiple requirements for efficient PG-mediated activation of the Imd pathway and demonstrate that PG is a complex immune elicitor.",

We tested how PO is activated following injury in 2 insects, i.e. the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the wax moth Galleria mellonella. Rapid PO activation in Drosophila was limited to discrete areas of the hemolymph clot which forms after injury. Surprisingly, unlike systemic PO activation during bacterial sepsis, clot melanization was not sensitive to microbial elicitors in our assay. Instead, Drosophila clot melanization was activated by endogenous signals such as apoptotic cells and was superinduced by phosphatidylserine, a negatively charged phospholipid normally found on the inner surface of the plasma membrane and exposed during apoptosis. In contrast, melanization in G. mellonella hemolymph was stronger and more uniform and was sensitive to peptidoglycan. This shows that both exogenous and endogenous signals can trigger the same immune mechanism in species- and context-dependent ways. Our findings have implications for the evolutionary dynamics of immune mechanisms and are in agreement with recent comparisons of insect immune transcriptomes.",

Relish activation is linked to proteasomal degradation of TAK1, the upstream MAP kinase kinase kinase required for JNK activation. Degradation of TAK1 leads to a rapid termination of JNK signaling, resulting in a transient JNK-dependent response that precedes the sustained induction of Relish-dependent innate immune loci. Because the IKK-NF-kappa B module also negatively regulates JNK activation in mammals, thereby controlling inflammation-induced apoptosis, the regulatory cross-talk between the JNK and NF-kappa B pathways appears to be broadly conserved.",

Mechanisms of innate immunity are highly conserved across species, and we take advantage of genetic tools in the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to study the effects of acute and chronic activation of immunity pathways on pathogen resistance and general fitness of adult flies. Our findings indicate that fat body specific overexpression of a putative pathogen recognition molecule, peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-LE), is sufficient for constitutive up-regulation of the immune response and for enhanced pathogen resistance. Primary components of fitness are unaffected by acute activation, but chronic activation leads to an inflammatory state and reduced lifespan. These phenotypes are dependent on the NFkappaB-related transcriptional factor, Relish, and they establish a mechanistic basis for a link between immunity, inflammation, and longevity.",

The information provided by the innumerous reports on Drosophila's immune response indicates that a large number of genes, in addition to the well-known antimicrobial peptide genes, are both up- and down-regulated upon immune challenge. Nevertheless, their contribution to fighting off infection has not been seriously addressed. With the application of recent advances in proteomics, the effects of an immune challenge in the overall modification of Drosophila 2-DE protein patterns were investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate hemolymph proteins differentially expressed between control and immunised larvae sets, which could be related solely to the Drosophila immune response. The list of immune-related protein spots included heat shock proteins and other proteins with chaperone properties, serine proteases, phenol oxidase, and Drosophila antioxidant system components, which accounted for 21% of the total of 70 identified proteins, metabolic enzymes implicated in pathways such as cellular respiration, fatty-acid oxidation, protein biosynthesis, and structural proteins.",

Mammalian host systems including rodents and rabbits are important tools in elucidating antifungal drug activity and the immunopathogenesis of IA. Nonetheless, they are hampered by limitations that impose a \"bottleneck\" in mass screening of novel antifungal compounds and putative Aspergillus virulence factors including their cost, labor intensity and ethical constraints. Drosophila melanogaster is an invertebrate host with a long tract record of genetic studies and a simple, yet highly conserved innate immune system. Herein, we describe our experience using this fly model as a facile, non-laborious, inexpensive pathosystem for high-throughput screening of novel antifungal compounds and putative Aspergillus mutants, and studying antifungal innate immunity. We present three infection protocols (i.e., injection, rolling, ingestion) that introduce Aspergillus either directly into the hemolymph or at different epithelial surfaces of Toll-deficient Drosophila flies. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate attenuated virulence of known hypovirulent Aspergillus strains and protection of Aspergillus-infected flies given oral Aspergillus-active agents such is voriconazole. These protocols can be adapted for similar studies of other fungal pathogens. Crossing and generation of Toll-deficient Drosophila flies takes 3 weeks; Aspergillus conidial preparation takes 3 days; fly inoculation depending on the infection assay takes 1 to 6-8 hours; and assessment of fly survival, Aspergillus strain virulence, Drosophila innate host parameters and/or drug activity takes 4-8 days.",

These include both cellular immune responses, such as the phagocytosis of invading microorganisms, and humoral immune responses, such as the secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the hemolymph [1] [2]. These defense systems are thought to interact, but the nature and extent of these interactions is not known. Here we describe a method for inhibiting phagocytosis in Drosophila blood cells (hemocytes) by injecting polystyrene beads into the body cavity. This treatment does not in itself make a fly susceptible to Escherichia coli infection. However, when performed on flies carrying the mutation immune deficiency (imd), which affects the humoral immune response [3], the treatment results in a striking decrease in resistance to infection. We therefore carried out a sensitized genetic screen to identify immunocompromised mutants by co-injecting beads and E. coli. From this screen, we identified a new gene we have named red shirt and identified the caspase Dredd as a regulator of the Drosophila immune response. The observation that mutants with defects in the humoral immune response are further immunocompromised by blocking phagocytosis, and thus inhibiting the cellular immune response, shows that the Drosophila cellular and humoral immune responses act in concert to fight infection.",

The properties of these receptors suggest that they may be involved in atherosclerosis and host defense. We have previously observed a similar receptor activity in Drosophila melanogaster embryonic macrophages and in the Drosophila macrophage-like Schneider L2 cell line. Expression cloning was used to isolate from L2 cells a cDNA that encodes a third class (class C) of scavenger receptor, Drosophila SR-CI (dSR-CI). dSR-CI expression was restricted to macrophages/hemocytes during embryonic development. When expressed in mammalian cells, dSR-CI exhibited high affinity and saturable binding of 125I-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein and mediated its chloroquine-dependent, presumably lysosomal, degradation. Although the broad polyanionic ligand-binding specificity of dSR-CI was similar to that of SR-A, their predicted protein sequences are not similar. dSR-CI is a 609-residue type I integral membrane protein containing several well-known sequence motifs, including two complement control protein (CCP) domains and somatomedin B, MAM, and mucin-like domains. Macrophage scavenger receptors apparently mediate important, well-conserved functions and may be pattern-recognition receptors that arose early in the evolution of host-defense mechanisms. Genetic and physiologic analysis of dSR-CI function in Drosophila should provide further insights into the roles played by scavenger receptors in host defense and development.",

Intermediate neoplasms are also found. These combine both benign and malignant qualities. They grow in a noninvasive, compact fashion, typical of benign tumors, yet they also exhibit malignant qualities such as fast, autonomous, and lethal growth, loss of differentiation capacity, changes in cellular morphology, and lethal growth after transplantation into wild-type hosts.

Spätzle specifically bound to Drosophila cells and to Cos-7 cells expressing Toll. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that the mature form of Spätzle bound to the Toll ectodomain with high affinity and with a stoichiometry of one Spätzle dimer to two receptors. The Spätzle pro-protein was inactive in all these assays, indicating that the pro-domain sequence, which is natively unstructured, acts to prevent interaction of the cytokine and its receptor Toll. These results show that, in contrast to the human Toll-like receptors, Drosophila Toll requires only an endogenous protein ligand for activation and signaling.",

Here we show a dramatic effect in the context of cellular immunity where, unlike embryonic development, Rac2 appears to have a non-redundant function. When an invading parasitoid is recognized as foreign, circulating hemocytes (blood cells) should recognize and attach to the egg chorion. After attachment the hemocytes should then spread to form a multilayered capsule surrounding the invader. In Rac2 mutants this process is disrupted. Immune surveillance cells, known as plasmatocytes, adhere to the parasitoid egg but fail to spread, and septate junctions do not assemble, possibly due to mislocalization of the Protein 4.1 homolog Coracle. Finally, larger cells known as lamellocytes attach to the capsule but also fail to spread, and there is a lack of melanization. From these results it appears that Rac2 is necessary for the larval cellular immune response.",

Previous studies in a Drosophila melanogaster model showed that binding of ACP to the sulfated polysaccharide chains (glycosaminoglycans) of HSPGs promotes host death and is associated with higher bacterial burdens. We hypothesized that ACP-glycosaminoglycan binding might determine infection outcome by altering host responses to infection, such as expression of antimicrobial peptides. As glycosaminoglycans/HSPGs also interact with a number of endogenous secreted signaling molecules in Drosophila, we examined the effects of host and pathogen glycosaminoglycan/HSPG-binding structures in host survival of infection and antimicrobial peptide expression. Strikingly, host survival after infection with wild-type streptococci was enhanced among flies overexpressing the endogenous glycosaminoglycan/HSPG-binding morphogen Decapentaplegic-a transforming growth factor β-like Drosophila homolog of mammalian bone morphogenetic proteins-but not by flies overexpressing a mutant, non-glycosaminoglycan-binding Decapentaplegic, or the other endogenous glycosaminoglycan/HSPG-binding morphogens, Hedgehog and Wingless. While ACP-glycosaminoglycan binding was associated with enhanced transcription of peptidoglycan recognition proteins and antimicrobial peptides, Decapentaplegic overexpression suppressed transcription of these genes during streptococcal infection. Further, the glycosaminoglycan-binding domain of ACP competed with Decapentaplegic for binding to the soluble glycosaminoglycan heparin in an in vitro assay. These data suggest that, in addition to promoting bacterial entry into host cells, ACP competes with Decapentaplegic for binding to glycosaminoglycans/HSPGs during infection and that these bacterial and endogenous glycosaminoglycan-binding structures determine host survival and regulate antimicrobial peptide transcription.",

Whereas the mechanisms leading to the production of ROS are rather well delineated, the mechanisms underlying tissue susceptibility or tolerance to oxidant stress remain elusive. Through an experimental selection over many generations, we have previously generated Drosophila melanogaster flies that tolerate tremendous oxidant stress and have shown that the family of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is over-represented in these tolerant flies. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that overexpression of even one AMP at a time (e.g. Diptericin) allows wild-type flies to survive much better in hyperoxia. In this study, we used a number of experimental approaches to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying hyperoxia tolerance in flies with AMP overexpression. We demonstrate that flies with Diptericin overexpression resist oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and preventing an increase in ROS levels after hyperoxia. Depleting the GSH pool using buthionine sulfoximine limits fly survival, thus confirming that enhanced survival observed in these flies is related to improved redox homeostasis. We conclude that 1) AMPs play an important role in tolerance to oxidant stress, 2) overexpression of Diptericin changes the cellular redox balance between oxidant and antioxidant, and 3) this change in redox balance plays an important role in survival in hyperoxia.",

         "Cecropins are antibacterial peptides, induced in insects in response to bacterial infections. In Drosophila, three cecropin genes have previously been characterized, CecA1, CecA2, and CecB, in a dense cluster at 99E on the third chromosome. From the same locus, we now describe a fourth member of the cecropin gene family, CecC, which is mainly expressed at the early pupal stage. In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box. It consists of three shorter motifs, two of which are reminiscent of a putative promoter element in immune protein genes from the cecropia moth.",

The levels of several proteins, including alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), increased in LPS-treated flies and were labelled as immune response proteins. However, because control larvae were not injected with ethanol alone the identified proteins could represent a response to ethanol. Here, we injected Drosophila larvae with combinations of ethanol and LPS. While ADH activity increased in larvae receiving 1% ethanol, it was not increased after LPS injection. These results suggest that ADH plays no role in the Drosophila immune response, and that other proteins identified in the previous study may instead mediate ethanol tolerance in flies and other organisms.",

Of the larval clotting factors identified in Drosophila, Fondue is not conserved in other insects, but is notable for its effects on the clot's physical properties, a possible function in the cuticle, and for being a substrate of transglutaminase. Transglutaminase is the only mammalian clotting factor found in Drosophila, and as it acts in coagulation in other invertebrates, it is also likely to be important in clotting in Drosophila. Here we describe a Fondue-GFP fusion construct that labels the cuticle and clot, and show that chemical inhibition and RNAi knockdown of the Drosophila transglutaminase gene affect clot properties and composition in ways similar to knockdown of the fon gene. Thus, Fondue appears to be incorporated into the cuticle and is a key transglutaminase substrate in the clot. This is also the first direct functional confirmation that transglutaminase acts in coagulation in Drosophila.",

To further elucidate this interaction we examined the activities of Rac1 and Rho1 in Drosophila cellular immune surveillance cells. In larvae the cellular immune response involves circulating cells (hemocytes) that can be recruited from a hematopoietic organ located behind the brain, as well as a sessile population found just underneath the larval cuticle. We demonstrate for the first time that Rho-kinase activation requires both Rho1 and the Drosophila c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Basket). We also show that Rac1, via Basket, regulates Rho1 activity, possibly by inhibiting RhoGAPp190. In the reciprocal pathway, co-expression of dominant negative Rho-kinase and constitutive active Rho1 induces a Rac1-like phenotype. This induction requires the formin Diaphanous. Co-expression of dominant negative Rho-kinase and constitutive active Rho1 also induces filopodia formation, with Diaphanous enriched at the tips. The Rac1-like phenotypes, and filopodia formation, could be blocked by co-expression of dominant negative Rac1. Finally, though dominant negative Rac1 is able to block filopodia formation in the overexpression experiments, only Rac2 is necessary for filopodia formed by hemocytes after parasitization.",

However, this 'overall' perspective under-emphasizes other critical aspects, such as the specificity, inducibility and timing of an immune response. Here, we investigate these aspects by examining gene regulation across several immune system components in both male and female Drosophila melanogaster prior to and after mating. To elucidate potentially important temporal dynamics, we also assayed several genes over time. We found that males and females emphasized different components of their immune system, however overall investment was similar. Specifically, the sexes emphasized different gene paralogues within major gene families, and males tended to invest more in gram-negative defence. By contrast, the inducibility of the immune response was both transient (lasting approx. 24 hours) and equal between the sexes. Furthermore, mating tended to induce humoral gene upregulation, while cell-mediated genes were unaffected. Within the humoral system, gram-negative bacterial defence genes exhibited a greater inducibility than those associated with fungal or gram-positive bacterial defence. Our results suggest that variation in the effectiveness of the immune response between the sexes may be driven by differences in emphasis rather than overall investment.",

We developed a zygomycosis model by injecting Drosophila melanogaster flies with a standardized amount of fungal spores from clinical Zygomycetes isolates to study virulence and host defense mechanisms. We found that, as opposed to most other fungi, which are nonpathogenic in D. melanogaster (e.g., Aspergillus fumigatus), Zygomycetes rapidly infect and kill wild-type flies. Toll-deficient flies exhibited increased susceptibility to Zygomycetes, whereas constitutive overexpression of the antifungal peptide Drosomycin in transgenic flies partially restored resistance to zygomycosis. D. melanogaster Schneider 2 phagocytic cells displayed decreased phagocytosis and caused less hyphal damage to Zygomycetes compared with that to A. fumigatus. Furthermore, phagocytosis-defective eater mutant flies displayed increased susceptibility to Zygomycetes infection. Classic enhancers of Zygomycetes virulence in humans, such as corticosteroids, increased iron supply, and iron availability through treatment with deferoxamine dramatically increased Zygomycetes pathogenicity in our model. In contrast, iron starvation induced by treatment with the iron chelator deferasirox significantly protected flies infected with Zygomycetes. Whole-genome expression profiling in wild-type flies after infection with Zygomycetes vs. A. fumigatus identified genes selectively down-regulated by Zygomycetes, which act in pathogen recognition, immune defense, stress response, detoxification, steroid metabolism, or tissue repair or have unknown functions. Our results provide insights into the factors that mediate host-pathogen interactions in zygomycosis and establish D. melanogaster as a promising model to study this important mycosis.",

We investigated the efficiency of the innate immune system in Drosophila carrying the longevity extending mutations puc (JNK signaling pathway, stress response) and chico (insulin signaling pathway), as well as animals subjected to dietary restriction (DR), which also extends lifespan. We found that puc heterozygous animals, as well as chico homozygous and heterozygous flies, have enhanced pathogen resistance. Surprisingly, diet manipulation did not reproducibly alter pathogen resistance, despite its significant effect on the expression of many immunity-related genes. Considering that chronic or frequent activation of the immune system results in reduced longevity, we postulate that the longevity extending potential of the above mutations may be partially obscured by parallel activation of the immune system. Such upregulation is not observed during DR, suggesting the presence of a mechanism that suppresses immune activity in diet-restricted animals.",

Animals typically exhibit considerable genetic variation in resistance to a variety of pathogens; however, little is known about whether animals can evolve tolerance. Using a bacterial infection model in Drosophila, we uncovered a p38 MAP kinase-mediated mechanism of tolerance to intracellular bacterial infection as measured by the extent to which the host's survival rate increased or was maintained despite increasing bacterial burden. This increased survival was conferred primarily by a tolerance strategy whereby p38-dependent phagocytic encapsulation of bacteria resulted in enlarged phagocytes that trap bacteria. These results suggest that phagocytic responses are not restricted to resistance mechanisms but can also be applied to tolerance strategies for intracellular encapsulation of pathogens during the invertebrate immune response.",

Relish is strongly induced in infected flies, and it can activate transcription from the Cecropin A1 promoter.

The upstream and the downstream sequences of the drosocin gene contain putative cis-regulatory elements similar to mammalian regulatory motifs, namely three kappa B-related decameric sequences. The drosocin gene is silent in naive animals, and is strongly induced with acute phase kinetics after immune challenge in larvae and in adults. We have established several transgenic fly lines in which reporter genes were placed under the control of various drosocin promoter sequences. Our results indicate that 2.5 kb of upstream sequences confer inducibility and tissue specificity to the transgene, but that the level of its expression in the fat body after immune challenge is low. Addition of genomic regions downstream of the drosocin transcribed sequences results in increased transcription levels, which are similar for the fusion and the resident drosocin genes upon infection.

Microarray results revealed reduced expression of various antimicrobial peptides that play a major role in the humoral immune response of the fly. Flies co-injected with a non-lethal dose of Destruxin A and the normally innocuous Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, showed increased mortality and an accompanying increase in bacterial titers. Mortality due to sepsis was rescued through ectopic activation of components in the IMD pathway, one of two signal transduction pathways that are responsible for antimicrobial peptide induction.

In the present study, we have used an in vivo RNAi strategy to inactivate 75 distinct Drosophila SP genes. We then screened this collection for SPs regulating the activation of the Toll pathway by gram-positive bacteria. Here, we report the identification of five novel SPs that function in an extracellular pathway linking the recognition proteins GNBP1 and PGRP-SA to Spz. Interestingly, four of these genes are also required for Toll activation by fungi, while one is specifically associated with signaling in response to gram-positive bacterial infections.

They form at least three functional classes; receptors required for immune gene expression; amidases that degrade peptidoglycan and scavenge the tissues from immune-stimulating peptidoglycan; and as proteins with antibacterial activity. We here report that PGRP-SB1 is an N-acetylmuramoyl l-alanine amidase, which (in contrast to the previously described PGRP-amidases) shows antibacterial activity. PGRP-SB1 is highly active against peptidoglycans that have a diaminopimelic acid (DAP) residue in the cross-linking peptide, but lack activity to most lysine-containing peptidoglycans. The antibacterial activity is pronounced against Bacillus megaterium with an LD(50) of 1.5microg ml(-1). The bactericidal effect of PGRP-SB1 is dependent on its enzymatic activity, as the zinc co-factor is essential. The bactericidal mode of action is thus different from non-enzymatic vertebrate PGRPs that have been reported to be antibacterial.",

Strikingly, all strains strongly impaired in fly killing also lacked twitching motility; most such strains had a mutation in pilGHIJKL chpABCDE, a gene cluster known to be required for twitching motility and potentially encoding a signal transduction system. The pil chp genes appear to control the expression of additional virulence factors, however, since the wild-type fly-killing phenotype of a subset of mutants isolated on the basis of their compact colony morphology indicated that twitching motility itself was not required for full virulence in the fly.",

We show that imd functions upstream of the DmIKK signalosome and the caspase DREDD in the control of antibacterial peptide genes. Strikingly, overexpression of imd leads to constitutive transcription of these genes and to apoptosis, and both effects are blocked by coexpression of the caspase inhibitor P35. We also show that imd is involved in the apoptotic response to UV irradiation. These data raise the possibility that antibacterial response and apoptosis share common control elements in Drosophila.",

For this, we have applied directly matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization MS to hemolymph samples from individual flies before and after an immune challenge. This method provided precise information on the molecular masses of immune-induced molecules and allowed the detection, in the molecular range of 1.5-11 kDa, of 24 Drosophila immune-induced molecules (DIMs). These molecules are all peptides, and four correspond to already characterized antimicrobial peptides. We have further analyzed the induction of the various peptides by immune challenge in wild-type flies and in mutants with a compromised antimicrobial response. We also describe a methodology combining matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight MS, HPLC, and Edman degradation, which yielded the peptide sequence of three of the DIMs. Finally, molecular cloning and Northern blot analyses revealed that one of the DIMs is produced as a prepropeptide and is inducible on a bacterial challenge.",

         "Insects rely primarily on innate immune responses to fight pathogens. In Drosophila, antimicrobial peptides are key contributors to host defense. Antimicrobial peptide gene expression is regulated by the IMD and Toll pathways. Bacterial peptidoglycans trigger these pathways, through recognition by peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). DAP-type peptidoglycan triggers the IMD pathway via PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, while lysine-type peptidoglycan is an agonist for the Toll pathway through PGRP-SA and PGRP-SD. Recent work has shown that the intensity and duration of the immune responses initiating with these receptors is tightly regulated at multiple levels, by a series of negative regulators. Through two-hybrid screening with PGRP-LC, we identified Rudra, a new regulator of the IMD pathway, and demonstrate that it is a critical feedback inhibitor of peptidoglycan receptor signaling. Following stimulation of the IMD pathway, rudra expression was rapidly induced. In cells, RNAi targeting of rudra caused a marked up-regulation of antimicrobial peptide gene expression. rudra mutant flies also hyper-activated antimicrobial peptide genes and were more resistant to infection with the insect pathogen Erwinia carotovora carotovora. Molecularly, Rudra was found to bind and interfere with both PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, disrupting their signaling complex. These results show that Rudra is a critical component in a negative feedback loop, whereby immune-induced gene expression rapidly produces a potent inhibitor that binds and inhibits pattern recognition receptors.",

         "The cellular events in the formation of melanotic tumors in the tu-W mutant larva of Drosophila melanogaster are described. The first step is the differentiation of spherical hemocytes to flattened cells, the lamellocyte variants. Subsequently, the surface of the caudal fat body undergoes changes to which the hemocytes respond by forming cellular capsules. The hemocytes utilize two mechanisms in this process: (1) phagocytosis of small particulate materials escaping from the adipose cells, (2) adhesion to form a multilayered wall of lamellocytes. Differentiating hemocytes in the vicinity of the tumor-forming site extrude membrane-bound vesicles that tend to adhere to the hemocyte surfaces. These vesicles are trapped between the lamellocytes as they pile in layers to form the capsule wall. It is suggested that the vesicles play a role in lamellocyte-to-lamellocyte adhesion during the initial stages of hemocyte aggregation at the tumor-forming site.",

         "The founding member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family was originally identified as a cell death inhibitor. However, recent evidence suggests that IAPs are multifunctional signaling devices that influence diverse biological processes. To investigate the in vivo function of Drosophila melanogaster IAP2, we have generated diap2 null alleles. diap2 mutant animals develop normally and are fully viable, suggesting that diap2 is dispensable for proper development. However, these animals were acutely sensitive to infection by gram-negative bacteria. In Drosophila, infection by gram-negative bacteria triggers the innate immune response by activating the immune deficiency (imd) signaling cascade, a NF-kappaB-dependent pathway that shares striking similarities with the pathway of mammalian tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1). diap2 mutant flies failed to activate NF-kappaB-mediated expression of antibacterial peptide genes and, consequently, rapidly succumbed to bacterial infection. Our genetic epistasis analysis places diap2 downstream of or in parallel to imd, Dredd, Tak1, and Relish. Therefore, DIAP2 functions in the host immune response to gram-negative bacteria. In contrast, we find that the Drosophila TNFR-associated factor (Traf) family member Traf2 is dispensable in resistance to gram-negative bacterial infection. Taken together, our genetic data identify DIAP2 as an essential component of the Imd signaling cascade, protecting the organism from infiltrating microbes.",

         "Eukaryotic organisms use a similar Rel/NF-kappaB signaling cascade for the induction of innate immune genes. In Drosophila, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) signal-induced activation of the Rel/NF-kappaB family transcription factors is an essential step in the transcriptional activation of inducible antimicrobial peptide genes. However, the mechanism by which the LPS-induced signaling pathway proceeds remains largely unknown. Here we have cloned a novel Drosophila LPS-activated kinase (DLAK) that is structurally related to mammalian IkappaB kinases. DLAK is expressed and transiently activated in LPS-responsive Drosophila cells following LPS stimulation. Furthermore, DLAK can interact with Cactus, a Drosophila IkappaB and phosphorylate recombinant Cactus, in vitro. Overexpression of dominant-negative mutant DLAK (DLAK(K50A)) blocks LPS-induced Cactus degradation. DLAK-bound Cactus can be degraded in a LPS signal-dependent fashion, whereas the DLAK(K50A) mutant-bound Cactus is completely resistant to degradation in the presence of LPS. The DLAK(K50A) mutant also inhibits nuclear kappaB binding activity and kappaB-dependent diptericin reporter gene activity in a dose-dependent manner, but the kappaB-dependent diptericin reporter gene activity can be rescued by overexpression of wild type DLAK. Moreover, mRNA analysis of various kappaB-dependent antimicrobial peptide genes shows that LPS inducibility of these genes is greatly impaired in cells overexpressing DLAK(K50A). These results establish that DLAK is a novel LPS-activated kinase, which is an essential signaling component for the induction of antimicrobial peptide genes following LPS treatment in Drosophila cells.",

         "Innate immunity in Drosophila is characterized by the inducible expression of antimicrobial peptides. We have investigated the development and regulation of immune responsiveness in Drosophila embryos after infection. Immune competence, as monitored by the induction of Cecropin A1-lacZ constructs, was observed first in the embryonic yolk. This observation suggests that the yolk plays an important role in the humoral immune response of the developing embryo by synthesizing antimicrobial peptides. Around midembryogenesis, the response in the yolk was diminished. Simultaneously, Cecropin expression became inducible in a large number of cells in the epidermis, demonstrating that late-stage embryos can synthesize their own antibiotics in the epidermis. This production likely serves to provide the hatching larva with an active antimicrobial barrier and protection against systemic infections. Cecropin expression in the yolk required the presence of a GATA site in the promoter as well as the involvement of the GATA-binding transcription factor Serpent (dGATAb). In contrast, neither the GATA site nor Serpent were necessary for Cecropin expression in the epidermis. Thus, the inducible immune responses in the yolk and in the epidermis can be uncoupled and call for distinct sets of transcription factors. Our data suggest that Serpent is involved in the distinction between a systemic response in the yolk/fat body and a local immune response in epithelial cells. In addition, the present study shows that signal transduction pathways controlling innate and epithelial defense reactions can be dissected genetically in Drosophila embryos.",

We have found that DmUbc9 binds and conjugates Drosophila Smt3 (DmSmt3) to Dorsal. In cultured cells, DmUbc9 was found to relieve inhibition of Dorsal nuclear uptake by Cactus, allowing Dorsal to enter the nucleus and activate transcription. The effect of DmUbc9 on Dorsal activity was potentiated by the overexpression of DmSmt3. We have also identified a DmSmt3-activating enzyme, DmSAE1/DmSAE2 and found that it further potentiates Dorsal-mediated activation.",

In the present, we report the physical interaction between GNBP1 and PGRP-SA using recombinant proteins. GNBP1 was able to hydrolyze Gram-positive peptidoglycan (PG), while PGRP-SA bound highly purified PG fragments (muropeptides). Interaction between these proteins was enhanced in the presence of PG or muropeptides. PGRP-SA binding depended on the polymerization status of the muropeptides, pointing to constraints in the number of PGRP-SA molecules bound for signaling initiation.

To gain insight into the role of ird1 in the immune response, we examine how amino acid starvation affects the immune signalling pathways in Drosophila. Starvation, in the absence of infection, leads to expression of antimicrobial peptide (AMP) genes and this response is dependent on ird1 and the Imd immune signalling pathway. Starvation, in addition to bacterial infection, suppresses the AMP response in wild-type animals and reduces the ability to survive M. luteus infection.

Drosophila uses two distinct immune signaling pathways, the Toll and immune deficiency (Imd) pathways, to respond to different classes of microbes. The Toll pathway is predominantly activated by Gram-positive bacteria and fungi, while the Imd pathway is primarily activated by Gram-negative bacteria. Recent work has suggested that this differential activation is achieved through peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP)-mediated recognition of specific forms of peptidoglycan (PG). In this study, we have further analyzed the specific PG molecular requirements for Imd activation through the pattern recognition receptor PGRP-LC in both cultured cell line and in flies. We found that two signatures of Gram-negative PG, the presence of diaminopimelic acid in the peptide bridge and a 1,6-anhydro form of N-acetylmuramic acid in the glycan chain, allow discrimination between Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Our results also point to a role for PG oligomerization in Imd activation, and we demonstrate that elements of both the sugar backbone and the peptide bridge of PG are required for optimum recognition. Altogether, these results indicate multiple requirements for efficient PG-mediated activation of the Imd pathway and demonstrate that PG is a complex immune elicitor.",

We tested how PO is activated following injury in 2 insects, i.e. the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the wax moth Galleria mellonella. Rapid PO activation in Drosophila was limited to discrete areas of the hemolymph clot which forms after injury. Surprisingly, unlike systemic PO activation during bacterial sepsis, clot melanization was not sensitive to microbial elicitors in our assay. Instead, Drosophila clot melanization was activated by endogenous signals such as apoptotic cells and was superinduced by phosphatidylserine, a negatively charged phospholipid normally found on the inner surface of the plasma membrane and exposed during apoptosis. In contrast, melanization in G. mellonella hemolymph was stronger and more uniform and was sensitive to peptidoglycan. This shows that both exogenous and endogenous signals can trigger the same immune mechanism in species- and context-dependent ways. Our findings have implications for the evolutionary dynamics of immune mechanisms and are in agreement with recent comparisons of insect immune transcriptomes.",

Relish activation is linked to proteasomal degradation of TAK1, the upstream MAP kinase kinase kinase required for JNK activation. Degradation of TAK1 leads to a rapid termination of JNK signaling, resulting in a transient JNK-dependent response that precedes the sustained induction of Relish-dependent innate immune loci. Because the IKK-NF-kappa B module also negatively regulates JNK activation in mammals, thereby controlling inflammation-induced apoptosis, the regulatory cross-talk between the JNK and NF-kappa B pathways appears to be broadly conserved.",

Understanding the mechanisms leading to immune system activation as well as the short- and long-term consequences of such activation on health and lifespan is therefore critical for the development of beneficial immuno-modulating and longevity-promoting interventions. Mechanisms of innate immunity are highly conserved across species, and we take advantage of genetic tools in the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, to study the effects of acute and chronic activation of immunity pathways on pathogen resistance and general fitness of adult flies. Our findings indicate that fat body specific overexpression of a putative pathogen recognition molecule, peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP-LE), is sufficient for constitutive up-regulation of the immune response and for enhanced pathogen resistance. Primary components of fitness are unaffected by acute activation, but chronic activation leads to an inflammatory state and reduced lifespan. These phenotypes are dependent on the NFkappaB-related transcriptional factor, Relish, and they establish a mechanistic basis for a link between immunity, inflammation, and longevity.",

With the application of recent advances in proteomics, the effects of an immune challenge in the overall modification of Drosophila 2-DE protein patterns were investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate hemolymph proteins differentially expressed between control and immunised larvae sets, which could be related solely to the Drosophila immune response. The list of immune-related protein spots included heat shock proteins and other proteins with chaperone properties, serine proteases, phenol oxidase, and Drosophila antioxidant system components, which accounted for 21% of the total of 70 identified proteins, metabolic enzymes implicated in pathways such as cellular respiration, fatty-acid oxidation, protein biosynthesis, and structural proteins.",

Mammalian host systems including rodents and rabbits are important tools in elucidating antifungal drug activity and the immunopathogenesis of IA. Nonetheless, they are hampered by limitations that impose a \"bottleneck\" in mass screening of novel antifungal compounds and putative Aspergillus virulence factors including their cost, labor intensity and ethical constraints. Drosophila melanogaster is an invertebrate host with a long tract record of genetic studies and a simple, yet highly conserved innate immune system. Herein, we describe our experience using this fly model as a facile, non-laborious, inexpensive pathosystem for high-throughput screening of novel antifungal compounds and putative Aspergillus mutants, and studying antifungal innate immunity. We present three infection protocols (i.e., injection, rolling, ingestion) that introduce Aspergillus either directly into the hemolymph or at different epithelial surfaces of Toll-deficient Drosophila flies. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate attenuated virulence of known hypovirulent Aspergillus strains and protection of Aspergillus-infected flies given oral Aspergillus-active agents such is voriconazole. These protocols can be adapted for similar studies of other fungal pathogens. Crossing and generation of Toll-deficient Drosophila flies takes 3 weeks; Aspergillus conidial preparation takes 3 days; fly inoculation depending on the infection assay takes 1 to 6-8 hours; and assessment of fly survival, Aspergillus strain virulence, Drosophila innate host parameters and/or drug activity takes 4-8 days.",

         "Drosophila has highly efficient defenses against infection. These include both cellular immune responses, such as the phagocytosis of invading microorganisms, and humoral immune responses, such as the secretion of antimicrobial peptides into the hemolymph [1] [2]. These defense systems are thought to interact, but the nature and extent of these interactions is not known. Here we describe a method for inhibiting phagocytosis in Drosophila blood cells (hemocytes) by injecting polystyrene beads into the body cavity. This treatment does not in itself make a fly susceptible to Escherichia coli infection. However, when performed on flies carrying the mutation immune deficiency (imd), which affects the humoral immune response [3], the treatment results in a striking decrease in resistance to infection. We therefore carried out a sensitized genetic screen to identify immunocompromised mutants by co-injecting beads and E. coli. From this screen, we identified a new gene we have named red shirt and identified the caspase Dredd as a regulator of the Drosophila immune response. The observation that mutants with defects in the humoral immune response are further immunocompromised by blocking phagocytosis, and thus inhibiting the cellular immune response, shows that the Drosophila cellular and humoral immune responses act in concert to fight infection.",

The properties of these receptors suggest that they may be involved in atherosclerosis and host defense. We have previously observed a similar receptor activity in Drosophila melanogaster embryonic macrophages and in the Drosophila macrophage-like Schneider L2 cell line. Expression cloning was used to isolate from L2 cells a cDNA that encodes a third class (class C) of scavenger receptor, Drosophila SR-CI (dSR-CI). dSR-CI expression was restricted to macrophages/hemocytes during embryonic development. When expressed in mammalian cells, dSR-CI exhibited high affinity and saturable binding of 125I-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein and mediated its chloroquine-dependent, presumably lysosomal, degradation. Although the broad polyanionic ligand-binding specificity of dSR-CI was similar to that of SR-A, their predicted protein sequences are not similar. dSR-CI is a 609-residue type I integral membrane protein containing several well-known sequence motifs, including two complement control protein (CCP) domains and somatomedin B, MAM, and mucin-like domains. Macrophage scavenger receptors apparently mediate important, well-conserved functions and may be pattern-recognition receptors that arose early in the evolution of host-defense mechanisms. Genetic and physiologic analysis of dSR-CI function in Drosophila should provide further insights into the roles played by scavenger receptors in host defense and development.",

Intermediate neoplasms are also found. These combine both benign and malignant qualities. They grow in a noninvasive, compact fashion, typical of benign tumors, yet they also exhibit malignant qualities such as fast, autonomous, and lethal growth, loss of differentiation capacity, changes in cellular morphology, and lethal growth after transplantation into wild-type hosts.

Spätzle specifically bound to Drosophila cells and to Cos-7 cells expressing Toll. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that the mature form of Spätzle bound to the Toll ectodomain with high affinity and with a stoichiometry of one Spätzle dimer to two receptors. The Spätzle pro-protein was inactive in all these assays, indicating that the pro-domain sequence, which is natively unstructured, acts to prevent interaction of the cytokine and its receptor Toll. These results show that, in contrast to the human Toll-like receptors, Drosophila Toll requires only an endogenous protein ligand for activation and signaling.",

Here we show a dramatic effect in the context of cellular immunity where, unlike embryonic development, Rac2 appears to have a non-redundant function. When an invading parasitoid is recognized as foreign, circulating hemocytes (blood cells) should recognize and attach to the egg chorion. After attachment the hemocytes should then spread to form a multilayered capsule surrounding the invader. In Rac2 mutants this process is disrupted. Immune surveillance cells, known as plasmatocytes, adhere to the parasitoid egg but fail to spread, and septate junctions do not assemble, possibly due to mislocalization of the Protein 4.1 homolog Coracle. Finally, larger cells known as lamellocytes attach to the capsule but also fail to spread, and there is a lack of melanization. From these results it appears that Rac2 is necessary for the larval cellular immune response.",

Previous studies in a Drosophila melanogaster model showed that binding of ACP to the sulfated polysaccharide chains (glycosaminoglycans) of HSPGs promotes host death and is associated with higher bacterial burdens. We hypothesized that ACP-glycosaminoglycan binding might determine infection outcome by altering host responses to infection, such as expression of antimicrobial peptides. As glycosaminoglycans/HSPGs also interact with a number of endogenous secreted signaling molecules in Drosophila, we examined the effects of host and pathogen glycosaminoglycan/HSPG-binding structures in host survival of infection and antimicrobial peptide expression. Strikingly, host survival after infection with wild-type streptococci was enhanced among flies overexpressing the endogenous glycosaminoglycan/HSPG-binding morphogen Decapentaplegic-a transforming growth factor β-like Drosophila homolog of mammalian bone morphogenetic proteins-but not by flies overexpressing a mutant, non-glycosaminoglycan-binding Decapentaplegic, or the other endogenous glycosaminoglycan/HSPG-binding morphogens, Hedgehog and Wingless. While ACP-glycosaminoglycan binding was associated with enhanced transcription of peptidoglycan recognition proteins and antimicrobial peptides, Decapentaplegic overexpression suppressed transcription of these genes during streptococcal infection. Further, the glycosaminoglycan-binding domain of ACP competed with Decapentaplegic for binding to the soluble glycosaminoglycan heparin in an in vitro assay. These data suggest that, in addition to promoting bacterial entry into host cells, ACP competes with Decapentaplegic for binding to glycosaminoglycans/HSPGs during infection and that these bacterial and endogenous glycosaminoglycan-binding structures determine host survival and regulate antimicrobial peptide transcription.",

Whereas the mechanisms leading to the production of ROS are rather well delineated, the mechanisms underlying tissue susceptibility or tolerance to oxidant stress remain elusive. Through an experimental selection over many generations, we have previously generated Drosophila melanogaster flies that tolerate tremendous oxidant stress and have shown that the family of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is over-represented in these tolerant flies. Furthermore, we have also demonstrated that overexpression of even one AMP at a time (e.g. Diptericin) allows wild-type flies to survive much better in hyperoxia. In this study, we used a number of experimental approaches to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying hyperoxia tolerance in flies with AMP overexpression. We demonstrate that flies with Diptericin overexpression resist oxidative stress by increasing antioxidant enzyme activities and preventing an increase in ROS levels after hyperoxia. Depleting the GSH pool using buthionine sulfoximine limits fly survival, thus confirming that enhanced survival observed in these flies is related to improved redox homeostasis. We conclude that 1) AMPs play an important role in tolerance to oxidant stress, 2) overexpression of Diptericin changes the cellular redox balance between oxidant and antioxidant, and 3) this change in redox balance plays an important role in survival in hyperoxia.",

In situ hybridization to immunized pupae show that CecC is induced in the anterior end of the larval hindgut and in other larval tissues that are undergoing histolysis. Within these other tissues it is often expressed in distinct foci that may correspond to hemocytes. A similar pattern of expression in the metamorphosing pupa is also observed for the CecA and CecB genes. Comparing the DNA sequences of the cecropin genes, a conserved region is observed about 30 bp upstream of the TATA box.

Here, we injected Drosophila larvae with combinations of ethanol and LPS. While ADH activity increased in larvae receiving 1% ethanol, it was not increased after LPS injection.

Transglutaminase is the only mammalian clotting factor found in Drosophila, and as it acts in coagulation in other invertebrates, it is also likely to be important in clotting in Drosophila. Here we describe a Fondue-GFP fusion construct that labels the cuticle and clot, and show that chemical inhibition and RNAi knockdown of the Drosophila transglutaminase gene affect clot properties and composition in ways similar to knockdown of the fon gene. Thus, Fondue appears to be incorporated into the cuticle and is a key transglutaminase substrate in the clot.

To further elucidate this interaction we examined the activities of Rac1 and Rho1 in Drosophila cellular immune surveillance cells. In larvae the cellular immune response involves circulating cells (hemocytes) that can be recruited from a hematopoietic organ located behind the brain, as well as a sessile population found just underneath the larval cuticle. We demonstrate for the first time that Rho-kinase activation requires both Rho1 and the Drosophila c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Basket). We also show that Rac1, via Basket, regulates Rho1 activity, possibly by inhibiting RhoGAPp190. In the reciprocal pathway, co-expression of dominant negative Rho-kinase and constitutive active Rho1 induces a Rac1-like phenotype. This induction requires the formin Diaphanous. Co-expression of dominant negative Rho-kinase and constitutive active Rho1 also induces filopodia formation, with Diaphanous enriched at the tips. The Rac1-like phenotypes, and filopodia formation, could be blocked by co-expression of dominant negative Rac1. Finally, though dominant negative Rac1 is able to block filopodia formation in the overexpression experiments, only Rac2 is necessary for filopodia formed by hemocytes after parasitization.",

         "Ecological immunology attempts to explain variation in immune function. Much of this work makes predictions about how potential hosts should invest in overall immunity. However, this 'overall' perspective under-emphasizes other critical aspects, such as the specificity, inducibility and timing of an immune response. Here, we investigate these aspects by examining gene regulation across several immune system components in both male and female Drosophila melanogaster prior to and after mating. To elucidate potentially important temporal dynamics, we also assayed several genes over time. We found that males and females emphasized different components of their immune system, however overall investment was similar. Specifically, the sexes emphasized different gene paralogues within major gene families, and males tended to invest more in gram-negative defence. By contrast, the inducibility of the immune response was both transient (lasting approx. 24 hours) and equal between the sexes. Furthermore, mating tended to induce humoral gene upregulation, while cell-mediated genes were unaffected. Within the humoral system, gram-negative bacterial defence genes exhibited a greater inducibility than those associated with fungal or gram-positive bacterial defence. Our results suggest that variation in the effectiveness of the immune response between the sexes may be driven by differences in emphasis rather than overall investment.",

         "Zygomycosis is an emerging frequently fatal opportunistic mycosis whose immunopathogenesis is poorly understood. We developed a zygomycosis model by injecting Drosophila melanogaster flies with a standardized amount of fungal spores from clinical Zygomycetes isolates to study virulence and host defense mechanisms. We found that, as opposed to most other fungi, which are nonpathogenic in D. melanogaster (e.g., Aspergillus fumigatus), Zygomycetes rapidly infect and kill wild-type flies. Toll-deficient flies exhibited increased susceptibility to Zygomycetes, whereas constitutive overexpression of the antifungal peptide Drosomycin in transgenic flies partially restored resistance to zygomycosis. D. melanogaster Schneider 2 phagocytic cells displayed decreased phagocytosis and caused less hyphal damage to Zygomycetes compared with that to A. fumigatus. Furthermore, phagocytosis-defective eater mutant flies displayed increased susceptibility to Zygomycetes infection. Classic enhancers of Zygomycetes virulence in humans, such as corticosteroids, increased iron supply, and iron availability through treatment with deferoxamine dramatically increased Zygomycetes pathogenicity in our model. In contrast, iron starvation induced by treatment with the iron chelator deferasirox significantly protected flies infected with Zygomycetes. Whole-genome expression profiling in wild-type flies after infection with Zygomycetes vs. A. fumigatus identified genes selectively down-regulated by Zygomycetes, which act in pathogen recognition, immune defense, stress response, detoxification, steroid metabolism, or tissue repair or have unknown functions. Our results provide insights into the factors that mediate host-pathogen interactions in zygomycosis and establish D. melanogaster as a promising model to study this important mycosis.",

We investigated the efficiency of the innate immune system in Drosophila carrying the longevity extending mutations puc (JNK signaling pathway, stress response) and chico (insulin signaling pathway), as well as animals subjected to dietary restriction (DR), which also extends lifespan. We found that puc heterozygous animals, as well as chico homozygous and heterozygous flies, have enhanced pathogen resistance. Surprisingly, diet manipulation did not reproducibly alter pathogen resistance, despite its significant effect on the expression of many immunity-related genes. Considering that chronic or frequent activation of the immune system results in reduced longevity, we postulate that the longevity extending potential of the above mutations may be partially obscured by parallel activation of the immune system. Such upregulation is not observed during DR, suggesting the presence of a mechanism that suppresses immune activity in diet-restricted animals.",

Animals typically exhibit considerable genetic variation in resistance to a variety of pathogens; however, little is known about whether animals can evolve tolerance. Using a bacterial infection model in Drosophila, we uncovered a p38 MAP kinase-mediated mechanism of tolerance to intracellular bacterial infection as measured by the extent to which the host's survival rate increased or was maintained despite increasing bacterial burden. This increased survival was conferred primarily by a tolerance strategy whereby p38-dependent phagocytic encapsulation of bacteria resulted in enlarged phagocytes that trap bacteria. These results suggest that phagocytic responses are not restricted to resistance mechanisms but can also be applied to tolerance strategies for intracellular encapsulation of pathogens during the invertebrate immune response.",

Relish is strongly induced in infected flies, and it can activate transcription from the Cecropin A1 promoter.

The upstream and the downstream sequences of the drosocin gene contain putative cis-regulatory elements similar to mammalian regulatory motifs, namely three kappa B-related decameric sequences. The drosocin gene is silent in naive animals, and is strongly induced with acute phase kinetics after immune challenge in larvae and in adults. We have established several transgenic fly lines in which reporter genes were placed under the control of various drosocin promoter sequences. Our results indicate that 2.5 kb of upstream sequences confer inducibility and tissue specificity to the transgene, but that the level of its expression in the fat body after immune challenge is low. Addition of genomic regions downstream of the drosocin transcribed sequences results in increased transcription levels, which are similar for the fusion and the resident drosocin genes upon infection. Analysis of transgenic fly lines showed that the drosocin reporter gene is constitutively expressed in the oviducts of egg-laying females.",

Aside from opening calcium channels, their in vivo mode of action during pathogenesis remains largely uncharacterized. To better understand the effects of a Destruxin, we looked at changes in gene expression following injection of Destruxin A into the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Microarray results revealed reduced expression of various antimicrobial peptides that play a major role in the humoral immune response of the fly. Flies co-injected with a non-lethal dose of Destruxin A and the normally innocuous Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, showed increased mortality and an accompanying increase in bacterial titers. Mortality due to sepsis was rescued through ectopic activation of components in the IMD pathway, one of two signal transduction pathways that are responsible for antimicrobial peptide induction. These results demonstrate a novel role for Destruxin A in specific suppression of the humoral immune response in insects.",

In the present study, we have used an in vivo RNAi strategy to inactivate 75 distinct Drosophila SP genes. We then screened this collection for SPs regulating the activation of the Toll pathway by gram-positive bacteria. Here, we report the identification of five novel SPs that function in an extracellular pathway linking the recognition proteins GNBP1 and PGRP-SA to Spz. Interestingly, four of these genes are also required for Toll activation by fungi, while one is specifically associated with signaling in response to gram-positive bacterial infections.

PGRP-SB1 is highly active against peptidoglycans that have a diaminopimelic acid (DAP) residue in the cross-linking peptide, but lack activity to most lysine-containing peptidoglycans. The antibacterial activity is pronounced against Bacillus megaterium with an LD(50) of 1.5microg ml(-1).

         "Insects rely primarily on innate immune responses to fight pathogens. In Drosophila, antimicrobial peptides are key contributors to host defense. Antimicrobial peptide gene expression is regulated by the IMD and Toll pathways. Bacterial peptidoglycans trigger these pathways, through recognition by peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). DAP-type peptidoglycan triggers the IMD pathway via PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, while lysine-type peptidoglycan is an agonist for the Toll pathway through PGRP-SA and PGRP-SD. Recent work has shown that the intensity and duration of the immune responses initiating with these receptors is tightly regulated at multiple levels, by a series of negative regulators. Through two-hybrid screening with PGRP-LC, we identified Rudra, a new regulator of the IMD pathway, and demonstrate that it is a critical feedback inhibitor of peptidoglycan receptor signaling. Following stimulation of the IMD pathway, rudra expression was rapidly induced. In cells, RNAi targeting of rudra caused a marked up-regulation of antimicrobial peptide gene expression. rudra mutant flies also hyper-activated antimicrobial peptide genes and were more resistant to infection with the insect pathogen Erwinia carotovora carotovora. Molecularly, Rudra was found to bind and interfere with both PGRP-LC and PGRP-LE, disrupting their signaling complex. These results show that Rudra is a critical component in a negative feedback loop, whereby immune-induced gene expression rapidly produces a potent inhibitor that binds and inhibits pattern recognition receptors.",
